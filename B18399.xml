            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:206435:4"/> Godly, is that which grieveth and vexeth the hearts of the wicked; the discourses of Mammon do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce the worldly man, and do not much affect a Godly man; the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Christ, pleaseth a Godly man, but it is irksome to a wicked man; that which a wicked man most shunneth, a Godly man prosecuteth with the greatest love and desires: that which a Godly man most hateth and abhorreth, that a wicked man most loveth and desireth: And as there is a contrariety of affections, so of courses and conversations; the one walketh to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the other to <hi>Canaan:</hi> the one hath communion with <hi>Belial,</hi> the other with Christ: the one hath fellowship with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and walketh in darkness; the other hath fellowship with the light: it was the saying of one, <hi>In eadem urbe sunt Antipodes;</hi> there are <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes</hi> in the same City: so I may say, the feet and wayes of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <p>Godliness is profitable unto all things as the ensuing discourse of our reverend Author will largely shew you: there is an universal fruit, benefit and profit in Godliness; it turneth all it toucheth, not into gold, but into that which is far better; it is of that soveraign vertue, that it makes a profitable use of all that it is applyed unto; it alters the very nature of things, making things in their own nature hurtful, to become helpful and advantagious.</p>
                  <p>Godliness is profitable to a man in all parts of his life; I speak of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness in the truth and power of it. 1. Even in the first Age, even in Childhood, it will teach even Ch l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to cry Hosanna to the Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.16, 17. it seasoneth the heart betimes with the dew of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. 2. It makes a man to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his Creator in the dayes of his
<pb facs="tcp:206435:9"/> youth, and to employ the strength of his life to the glory of his Creator, while yet the evil dayes come not: Youth and Childhood is the seed time of grace and goodness, and the whole lump of our lives is sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the sanctification of these first-fruits.<note place="margin">The word cleansig signifies the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of glass, the young man is compared to glass, which though clean, yet will gather filth even in the Sun beams.</note> As the younger sort of people is subject to much vanity and many temptations; so godliness is very profitable for that age, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the young man to * cleanse his way, by taking heed thereunto ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods word, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.9. 3. Godliness is profitable for the riper years of man; it is profitable to establish the heart with grace at that age, and to keep it from being stollen away from God by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it then makes a man more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous of remembring God himself, seeing he is hastening apace into ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inous old age. 4. Godliness is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for the last part of a mans
<pb facs="tcp:206435:9"/> life, <hi>viz.</hi> old age: it is for comfort to it; old age is subject to many grievances; <hi>there will evil dayes come, wherein they shall say they have no pleasure:</hi> there are many decayes and infirmities of nature in old men, which make their dayes evil and unpleasant, when the clouds return after the rain, and the end of one trouble is the beginning of another; when the Cross is a burden, and small matters are burdensome to them; now godliness is profitable in this regard, it yields ground of special comfort in old age, because a godly man knows when this earthly Tabernacle shall be dissolved, he hath a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens: When a soul hath been long acquainted with Christ, and desireth to be dissolved, to be with Christ, which is best of all, Oh what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is this to his soul, when he finds
<pb facs="tcp:206435:10"/> that the day of his redemption draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nigh! Godliness is profitable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for strength in old age: for as their outward man decayeth, so their inner man grows stronger and stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: then is the life of faith, and the power of grace more strong and vigorous in them, to put health in sickness, strength in weakness, ease in pain: we read of those worthies, Heb. 11. <hi>that out of weakness they were made strong by faith:</hi> they are fat and flourishing in grace, and bring forth more fruit in old age: Godliness is also for an honor to old age: the pride of youth is apt to cast scorn and contempt upon old age, which it ought to honour, but <hi>Gray hairs are a Crown of honour, when they are found in a way of righteousness and godliness</hi> Prov. 16 31. But 4. Most profitable is death to the godly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21. <hi>All things are yours,</hi> saith the Apostle;
<pb facs="tcp:206435:10"/> among these all things he reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Death:</hi> to the ungodly it may be said, <hi>you are Death's,</hi> but death is not yours. As it may be said of souldiers taken in battel, they are not their own men, but are prisoners lying at the mercy of the enemy: so death takes the ungodly, they are deaths prisoners and captives: but to the godly I may say, <hi>death is yours, your friend, your servant,</hi> to let you into happiness; <hi>Death is the Porter of the presence chamber;</hi> it admits the godly in to see and know God as he is. When <hi>Jacob</hi> heard that his son <hi>Joseph</hi> was alive, his spirit revived; and <hi>Israel said, it is enough;</hi> Joseph <hi>my son is yet alive, I will go and see him before I die:</hi> and with what joy was <hi>Jacob</hi> affected when he saw his son, whom he had thought long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to have been a prey to some cruel beast? When death cometh, a godly man saith it is enough, it
<pb facs="tcp:206435:11"/> is enough; My godliness and Christ ever liveth: Oh let me die, that I may go and see the sweet and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious face of my blessed Redeemer: and cryes out as a dying godly man once did, Come ye fiery Chariots and catch me up into Heaven where I may see God; Come ye blessed Angels and carry me upon your wings to the sight and presence of the Lord; or as St. <hi>Augustines</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Volemus in coelum, Volemus in coelum;</hi> Come, let us fly, let us fly to heaven: a godly man saith to the day of death, <hi>O Beata dies,</hi> O blessed day, when I shall enter into my Masters joy! Finally, Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is profitable to eternity, John 15.16. <hi>I have ordained you</hi> (saith Christ to his Disciples) <hi>that you should go, and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain.</hi> The fruit of godliness is not like Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fruit, that perisheth, but it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth,
<pb facs="tcp:206435:11"/> it is everlasting joy and glory; Oh how sweet shall the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of godliness be to the Saints for ever and ever! These things being considered, I cannot but wonder with <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> that that man doth not digg a pit in the ground to hide his head in, that shall dare to open his mouth, and speak against Godliness.</p>
                  <p>Now much honoured Sir, to you and to your Worthy Lady, do I dedicate this Tract of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Godliness, together with the three other Discourses annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the first shewing the Unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness of Worldly Gain; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond shewing the danger of being an Unfruitful Tree in Gods Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; the last shewing that none but the violent Christian doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Let me exhort you to grow in grace, and to increase in godliness;
<pb facs="tcp:206435:12"/> it is observed, that in Scripture there are more exhortations to a good life than to faith: there is no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament doth so well become you as godliness; as the Gold Ring decketh the Pearl that is embossed in it; the Silver Coyn sets out the stamp that is engraven in it; the sweet face commends the amorous eye that rolleth in it; the Royal Robe gives a lustre to the Prince that is invested in it; the glorious Heaven beautifies the Sun that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned in it; so doth godliness adorn and beautifie him that hath it. Beware of unlawful Gain, for that will make a mans Bread to be as gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel between his teeth, and his drink as wormwood to his taste. Labour I beseech you to abound in all the fruits of righteousness; it is better to be in your Countrey as Trees in a Garden bearing fruit, then as Trees in a Waste, to make a shew and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
<pb facs="tcp:206435:12"/> only. Oh how doth the Devil teach many Great Persons to sin now a little, and then a little, and to trifle away the greatest part of their time about unnecessary things, till at last they become rich in sin, and bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in grace! Sin will thrive in your souls, if grace doth not. Offer ye Violence to the Kingdom of Heaven, since none but the violent do take the City of God: <hi>Appetitus summi boni est infinitus;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Violencilo rapiscono.</note> that which a man makes his chiefest good, his desire of it is unsatiable, and he laboureth with all his might to obtain it.

And now Funeral Sermons are for the living, not for the dead; like your flowers upon the Corpse, not for the Corpse, but for those that have the smell of them; therefore it is my way (for the most part) to wave to speak of those that are departed; yet I do not so tye up my self, as not to speak something upon such an occasion as this of a Godly Minister, and faithful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If I do a little improve this sad oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, pardon me; This our Brother was dear to me, not only upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the relation as a Minister, but
<pb facs="tcp:206435:14"/> also of a particular relation to my self, which it may not seem in vain to speak of. When it pleased God to call me into these parts to undertake such a great charge as the care of souls, then this our Reverend Brother, and your dear Pastor came as Collegiat with me; he did not stay long there, but was chosen your Pastor and Minister; and now, if so be that in the speaking of him, a little grief doth any way interrupt me, do not think it unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Our Saviour Christ did discover his tears about <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and the Jews said, <hi>Behold how he loved him!</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 11.35, 36.</note> So if in speaking of such a relation, such an acquaintance, and such a loss, there be any interruption, it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly.</p>
                  <p>I have but two things to speak to; As he that commendeth a Picture or Image, doth not so much commend that, as the Artificer that made it; so if I tell you, what gifts, abilities, graces God wrought in this your Pastor, it is

                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> It was an able, Scriptural, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing preaching; it is great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in any people to know what is good Preaching, and what are good Sermons; now this one thing, the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the ability and dexterity of a Minister in applying of Scripture to peoples hearts; he that instructeth and convinceth by Scripture, he that reproveth, that comforteth by Scripture, he cometh with <hi>[Thus saith the Lord]</hi> and the wit of man cannot overcome him: <hi>Thus saith the Lord;</hi> and then the lust and pride of man, and all
<pb facs="tcp:206435:15"/> must yield. Now this our Brother was such a Preacher; A man may be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Scholar, and yet want dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of preaching; Where there is a great deal of learning, there is not alwayes this dexterity: Our Brother was a <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, which signifies, one that hath skill in Scripture, one that instructeth, enliveneth, enflameth: so that when a man cometh and heareth such a man, he saith, Verily this man hath more than Books, learning, parts: he hath God in his heart and tongue, working in him and wish him: that is one thing; the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal abilities of this our Brother in this way of preaching which you can witness.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> The second thing was his use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, practical, profitable, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful preaching: the Sower went out to sow Wheat: not Chaff, but Seed-wheat; and now this you may witness too, that our Brothers preaching was a use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, powerful, practical way, in all things tending to your edification: to
<pb facs="tcp:206435:16"/> what purpose is it for a man to have a golden tongue, if the heart be not enflamed therewith? and therefore this way of practical preaching, whereby the Kingdome of sin is destroyed, and grace begotten, and people edified, this is the great, the excellent way: Eloquence is commendable, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity doth not renounce it, but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh subservient to heavenly preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if it be the handmaid. But there is little in affected words and charms of meer Bumbaste: though many men may delight to hear them, yet give me that which will rather make thy heart weep, than thine ears to tingle; that which will send thee home, and make thee cry, Oh I cannot sleep for my sins! that which will make thee cry out, Oh my sin, my sin! as <hi>David</hi> cried out of his Son, <hi>O Absolom, my Son, my Son!</hi> this affectionate way is the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and profitable way.</p>
                  <p>This our Brother did use all kinds of wayes of preaching: he tried a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical
<pb facs="tcp:206435:16"/> and a Rhetorical way of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, (I mean according to humane wayes) and he saw that would do no good; therefore he betook himself to a powerful, practical way of preaching, that way whereby the mind is enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the heart wrought upon, and this was our Brothers preaching. Oh it is better to speak one word to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, then five hundred words in a meer vain, empty, fantastical way!</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> His preaching was affectionate, serious, inward; it was more than Books or words, more then studied words, and learned Sermons, though these be necessary, and of great use (mistake me not) it was inward and affectionate; it was with inward work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of heart, with love to God, with love to your souls, and to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of them: this is a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when we come (as the Apost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:206435:17"/> is more; the heart and the affection of a Preacher is more: this warm milk from the breast is that which nourisheth the Child: for a man to speak of regeneration, and himself not know what it is for a Minister to preach of living by faith; and other truths, and for himself not to know the meaning of them experimentally, what is it but even as <hi>Sampson's</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? he had honey in his mouth, yet was a dead carcass, so that he was never the better for it, he tasted it not: so let a Minister deliver never so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent divine truths; if he have not the working of these upon his own heart, he is but as <hi>Sampsons</hi> dead Lion with honey in his mouth; he speaks that he knows not the meaning of.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4.</hi> His preaching was constant, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, assiduous preaching: these very walls, this very place can tell you how diligent he was in preaching. His dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence appeared that notwithstanding the pain he felt, yet he was constant
<pb facs="tcp:206435:17"/> in preaching to you: he hath been in torment in his body, and in great pain, whiles he was in declaring the will of God unto you: this declared his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy and diligence, that he would not spare the pains of his body, nor the torture he had, but travelled in soul and body for you at the same time together; thus much for his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>As for his Life, your selves also are witnesses of a holy life, which is the great commendation of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. It was the great complaint of <hi>Luther,</hi> nothing made him so weary of his Ministry as this, I cannot live as I have Preached; And truly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may affect a godly Minister so much as this, that he cannot live as he preacheth: that he cannot put forth those works of grace which he declares to others: Ministers are not Angels; we are not freed from infirmities; but God by his good grace keeps those that are faithful, that they are unspotted
<pb facs="tcp:206435:18"/> in the world. I dare not to be of the <hi>Donatists</hi> mind, that thought that the Administration of Sacraments, and the Preaching of ungodly Ministers, could not be of Edification to Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or Conversion: no, the Church hath exploded that Opinion; for that would be to make the Promises of God to be made not to the Institution it self, nor to the right disposition of the subject employed therein, but to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of the Minister, and the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penser thereof: Whereas we see the Scripture is otherwise: Yet it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the prophaness of <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons made the people to abhor the sacrifice of God: therefore drunkenness, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faness, wickedness, unprofitableness in a Minister, are great aggravations of their sin. As a deformed <hi>Limner</hi> drawing a curious Picture, makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the more ridiculous: so the better Sermons a prophane Minister preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he doth but make himself the more ridiculous; he sheweth what himself
<pb facs="tcp:206435:18"/> should be, but is not: But now by the grace of God our dear Brother his life was a confirmation of his doctrine; you know it among you, and it was convincing of you: Our lives ordered with all tenderness and prudence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, converting and teaching lives.</p>
                  <p>And the Lord to increase his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to exercise his faith and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, was pleased in his latter dayes to afflict him with that sad and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous pain of the <hi>Stone,</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences thereof; a pain so great, that one of the Philosophers was of the judgement, that all pain was but a Phantasie, and a meer imagination, yet being under the pain of the Stone (as I remember) he cryed out, he was deceived: It pleased the Lord to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise our dear Brother thus, afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with this disease, and that a long time together, and so made him as it were a Prisoner in his house: he
<pb facs="tcp:206435:19"/> was often afraid that he should die a miserable, tormenting, painful death: it was his great fear because of the torturing pain that was upon him: but behold the mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God to him, that gave him an easie death, so that he scarce felt what pain was: see how often we trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our selves with needless fears, which the Lord never brings upon us!

And although he be now dead, yet let his Sermons, let his Exhortations live: as <hi>Paul</hi> said to the <hi>Corinthians, 2</hi> Cor. <hi>3.2. Ye are our Epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:</hi> So you of this Town of <hi>Walsall,</hi> you have your Pastors Sermons written in your hearts and lives: the whole Country knoweth that you have had a Prophet among you: you must one day answer for every Sermon he preached among you: you must be accountable for all his studies, for all the pains he took and endured, for all the strength and blood that he spent, for the life he spent in doing good to your souls: these things
<pb facs="tcp:206435:20"/> you must come to an account for: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore entreat ye the Lord that he would make you sensible of these things, and that they may be useful to you for your good; And now therefore seeing the Will of the Lord is done, be earnest with God that he would provide such a Pastor for you, that what your deceased Pastor plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he that shall succeed may water, and the great God of Heaven give increase. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                           <p>IN prosecution of the point I must shew,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. What is Godl ness.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. That it is beneficial and profitable to to all things.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The reasons why it is so.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. What is Godliness.</p>
                           <p>It is of absolute concernment to know what is true Godliness, to which Heaven and Earth is promised, that so our hopes of erernal life may not make us ashamed at the last: there are many who lay claim to the promises of Heaven, that have no more right to them or Heaven, than the foolish Virgins, presuming that they were godly, and claimed to Heaven, but were with shame thrust down from Heaven-gates into Hell among the ungodly.</p>
                           <p>There is a fourfold Godliness; three sorts are supposed and esteemed by men to be Godliness, but are not; there is but one true real substantial Godliness.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. There is a civil Godliness, which is nothing else but a civil, moral and ingenious deportment of a man's self among and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:206435:27"/> men, consisting of the negative part of Godliness; as to be no drunkard, no swearer, no adulterer, no unjust person; such was the Godliness of the Pharisees: God, I thank thee, I am not as yonder Publican is; this among the generality of men is reputed very Godliness; but alas! it cometh as short of the glory of true Godliness, as the light of a Candle cometh of the glory of the Sun: if this were God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, then there may be as true Godliness among Pagans and Infidels, who know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God and Christ, as among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: Yea, many Heathens have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eminent for civil righteousness, and a moral conversation, even to the shame of many Christians. Do but think what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of persons the foolish Virgins were; you may conclude that civil righteousness is not Godliness; for they were such, yet they had neither promise nor possession of the life to come, which they should have had, if civil and moral righteousness be true Godliness; yet though this be not Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, yet civility shall so far profit them, as that their torment in Hell shall be less than the torment of others.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. There is an humane, voluntary, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised Godliness, which in my Text is called
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:206435:28"/> Bodily exercise; and is nothing else but a rigid discipline of the body, with much fasting and abstinence from some meats for certain dayes and weeks together, eating of Herbs, lying on the ground, separating themselves from worldly business, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil society of men, living in Wildernesses, Cells, Monasteries, and austerity of life, which God commandeth not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore approveth not of. Yet this strictness of life, this neglecting of the body (as the Apostle termeth it) is highly magnified by Papists, as if it were a divine and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Godliness: but this is not Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth here oppose God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness to this bodily exercise; and it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to any observing eye, that none are greater enemies to the power of Godliness then such devout persons. Such was the Godliness of the Pharisees, who placed worship and religion in washing hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meat, in washing pots and cups, in fasting twice a week, in wearing heavy mortars on their heads, and tying thorns to their heels. Men may please themselves with these or the like devised devotions, but God abhors them; all that can be said for such wayes is that of the Apostle, Colos. 2.23, <hi>they have a shew of wisdom,</hi>
                              <pb n="15" facs="tcp:206435:28"/> of humility, of devotion, of Godliness, as bright brass harh a shew of gold, but it is not; and as painted flowers have a shew of flowers, but are not.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. There is an Hypocritical Godliness, which is (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5.) the form of Godliness; the whole exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal shape of it; it hath all the outward patts of it, it wanteth nothing but the power of it; As a dead man hath all the outward parts of a man, there is not a member wanting, but only he hath no life, no soul in him; so an Hypocrite hath all the visible parts of Godliness, in respect of duty, and in respect of grace, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he heareth the word, he fasteth, he receiveth the Sacraments, he liveth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameably before men; he hath all grace in appearance; seeming faith, love, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, sobriety, zeal, obedience; but there is no power nor life in him; this (like bodily exercise) profits him a little, it gaineth the name and credit of religion to him, he is commended and applauded, he hath the praise of men; this is all the profit Hypocrisie bringeth; but the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite hath no promises made to him, but the dreadful threatnings of woe, death, and damnation to come.</p>
                           <p n="4">
                              <pb n="16" facs="tcp:206435:29"/>4. There is a true substantial Godliness, which God commandeth, approveth, and delighteth in, to which he hath made all promises of heaven and earth. What this Godliness is, I must now shew, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it doth consist.</p>

                              <note place="margin">Luther.</note> said of unjust profit, it is <hi>lucrum in arca, damnum in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientia:</hi> it is gain in the purse, but it is loss in the conscience; at last it will sting like a Serpent, and bite like an Adder: that which makes a man to smile now, will make him to sigh hereafter; that which makes him proud now, will confound him with shame at the last: riches, be they more or less gotten in Gods way, will be found sweet gain.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Godliness is it that brings a blessing upon our labours for worldly gain. <hi>Psal.</hi> 128. <hi>Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord, and walketh in his wayes; for thou shalt eat the labour of thy hands; happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee, ver.</hi> 1, 2. The fear of God will bring a blessing upon the labour of your hands; thou shalt not only by thy labour provide food and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but it shall be well with thee; thou shalt treasure up gain; it is ungodlniess that cloatheth men with raggs.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. It will put us upon seeking outward gain in due order; first the Kingdom of God, then these things; first Heaven, then Earth; first Christ and Grace, then mony
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:206435:34"/> and riches; first a sure title to Heaven, then possessions on Earth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. It is because men are ungodly, therefore they seek for earthly things before heavenly: it is ungodliness that makes men seek to defer seeking pardon, Grace and Heaven to the last; it is ungodliness that makes men take immoderate pains for earth, and makes them so slack and negligent in soul-saving commodities; were men godly, they would see a necessity of Grace, of Heaven, of Salvation; it is absolutely necessary to be saved; it is not necessary that I am rich, but I must be saved.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Godliness will enable thee to improve thy riches to the glory of God, and the furtherance of thine own salvation: it is Godliness that will make thee honour the Lord with thy substance, and to feed Christ in his members. 'Tis Godliness that will make us wise and faithful servants in improving our talents for our Masters use; this will bring comfort to our souls, and admittance into the Masters joy: it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness that makes men to lay out their gain on their pride, vanity, lusts; it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness that makes men the more wicked, by how much the more rich they are: we must all give an account of the use of our

                        <p>A promise is the word of God given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, whereby he binds himself,<note place="margin">Definit. of a Promise.</note> and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureth them, that he will freely bestow good things upon them, and remove evil things from them: it is convenient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider

                        <p n="1">1. I say, it is the word of God given to man; for as the civil promise of a man is his word given to another for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of some lawful thing; so a Divine promise is the word of God given for the performance of good things; it differs from a covenant or contract, because in them there is a mutual restipulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both parties: as in the covenant of grace, God promiseth to be our God, and we again promise to be his people: but now a promise is Gods own act, requiring no restipulation from us, but only our faith in his promise; but yet whether we believe or not believe his word given to us, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="3">3. <hi>To assure us.]</hi> We take the promise of a man for security to assure us of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance: it is the end why men pass their word to one another, to assure one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their performances. So God hath given his word to assure us that he will give us all good things; no greater security then the word of a God who cannot lye, who
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:206435:46"/> will not deceive, who can and will effect what his mouth hath spoken, this sure word given to us is the ground of our faith, hope, expectation, confidence. A godly man may boldly say, I shall have the things of this life, God hath given his word that I shall have them: I shall have heaven for mine inheritance, I have the word of God for it; I shall want no good thing, I have Gods word for this; I am as confident of having them, as if I had them already in hand; the word of God given to us is as certain as actual performance.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That he will freely bestow all good things upon us, and remove evil things from us: here we have the matter of the promises.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That he will bestow all good things; as threatnings are of evil things, so promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are of good things: God will bestow the good things of this life on us, food and raiment, and whatsoever is good for us; the good things of spiritual and eternal life; there is not one thing which he knows to be good for us, but he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow in his appointed season: when his hour is come, he will turn all our water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wine, and stones into bread, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. we shall obtain grace and mercy to help in

                        <p n="2">2. But God hath promised also the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of all evil from us: privative, as well as positive mercies are the matter of divine promises: it is a question which of them are the greater; I will not now exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. To be kept from evil, to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of evil, to be redeemed from all wrath to come, to be saved from everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing damnation, to have all tears wiped from our eyes, that destruction shall not come nigh us, are desirable mercies which God hath promised, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.4. God shall wipe away all tears from our eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: to be in a perfect state of happiness as also freed from all fears of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture misery, is the promise of the life to come.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. It is said <hi>freely</hi> bestow.] For albeit God hath bound himself by his word to bestow good things, yet all we receive from him is freely given: his word of promise is freely given to us: the mercies promised are free gifts: there is nothing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:206435:47"/> in us to move God to make such promises to us: there is no merit in us deserving ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promise or mercy; our disobedience forfeited all; restitution of any thing is an act of free grace; all temporal as well as eternal mercies flow from the grace of God; when we receive any mercy, even the least of them, we ought to cry out as they in <hi>Zachary,</hi> at the laying of the corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of the Temple, <hi>grace, grace:</hi> that we have food and rayment, it is grace, grace; that we have health and strength, tis grace, grace.</p>

St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of the fifth Commandment, <hi>This is the first Commandment with promise,</hi> Eph. 6. and we may observe, that in the Old Testament the promises of temporal mercies are more common then in the New, where promises of spiritual mercies are more common: The reason why God made so many temporal promises to them under the Law, was because that service did most consist in the observation of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, and carnal Ordinances, as the Apostle ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

That all the promises of the life pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and to come, are revealed and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to wicked men as so many urgent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations to faith and holiness: the Scriptures use all arguments to perswade them to Godliness; arguments drawn from mercies, from judgments, from promised rewards, and threatned judgments, from the worst of evils [damnation] and from
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:206435:59"/> the best of good things [salvation] <hi>Go,</hi> saith Christ to his Apostles, <hi>and preach the Gospel to every creature,</hi> and make this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and threatning, That <hi>whosoever shall believe shall be saved, and whosoever believeth not shall be damned:</hi> Offer the promise of salvation to every creature; hence the great promises run indefinitely and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally without exception and limitation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Every wicked man is commanded to believe the promises, and to come up to the duties annexed to the promises; they are commanded to repent, to believe, to be holy in all manner of conversation; it is their duty to repent; and upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and turning from their evil ways, the promises shall be made good to them: it is their going on in sin that keeps them off from having interest in the promises; while such they are, they can lay no more claim to any one promise of God, than a beggar to a Kingdom.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Notwithstanding the promises are proposed and offered to wicked men, yet in <hi>statu quo,</hi> while they continue wicked, they are under all Scripture woes, threatnings, and curses: our Saviour speaks terrible words, <hi>that they are condemned already,</hi> and <hi>that the wrath of God abideth on them,</hi>
                           <pb n="77" facs="tcp:206435:59"/> which is meant in respect of threatnings: Whiles we lye under the threatnings of God, we lye under the wrath of God: Divine threatnings are Gods wrath, as well as divine plagues. Consider this ye that are Drunkards, while you are such, ye lye under that threatning, <hi>No Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard shall inherit the Kingdom of God, and of Christ;</hi> how dare you then lie one hour more in that sin? did wicked men consider Gods threatnings, how could they be secure, and sleep (as <hi>Peter</hi>) amidst a quaternion of direful threatnings.?</p>

Because these outward things are all the good they shall have from a good God; it is all the Heaven that wicked and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men shall have; they have their portion in the things of this life; so <hi>Abraham</hi> told the rich glutton in Hell torments, <hi>Son, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thou in thy life time hadst thy good things.</hi>

                           <p>More reasons might be given, but I will rather shew some difference between Gods giving the things of this life to the wicked and to the godly.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. God giveth these things to his own, as their Father in Christ; he gives them to wicked men, as he is the common Father of all by right of Creation; so he provideth for the beasts, and all creatures in the world.</p>

                           <p n="3">3. Godly men have them as the fruit of Gods promise; wicked men have them as the fruit of Gods providence, and so other creatures have them.</p>

                        <p>What <hi>Solomon</hi> saith of wisdom, may be spoken of the soul: <hi>The Merchandise of it is better than the Merchandise of Silver, and the gain thereof than fine Gold: She is more precious than Rubies, and all the things thou canst desire, are not to be compared to her:</hi> desire riches, and all manner of precious things, and as many of them as thou canst desire; yet the whole world, and ten worlds more are not to be compared to the soul of a man: There is no valuable considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a soul, but only the precious blood of Jesus Christ. This truth will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if we consider these following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Consider what a most precious thing the soul of man is in it self: I shall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on all the particular excellencies of the soul, as its divine original, that it cometh from the hands of God immediately; the Father of Spirits is still breathing this breath of life into the body by Creation; the very Philosopher calleth the soul, <hi>divinae aure particulam.</hi> Neither will I speak of the immateriality and spirituality of the soul: albeit it is the noble excellency of the soul of man, that it is a spiritual substance: it
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:206435:81"/> is a spirit; so God is, so the holy Angels are ministring spirits. Neither will I speak of the more noble faculties of the soul, the understanding and will: As it is an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing spirit, so all things whatsoever are within the souls cognizance, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive of every intelligible object; it is a willing spirit, because it can embrace every good.</p>

I shall present these particulars to your consideration.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Consider how God the Maker and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:206435:83"/> Creator of all souls esteems and valueth them: nothing in all the world is precious to him but souls; that he was willing to give his Son out of his bosom, to be the price of souls. <hi>God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son;</hi> he so deeply loved the souls of men, that he gave not a world to save them; that price would not obtain one soul, neither did he give an Angel from Heaven, nor many Angels from Heaven, to be the price of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of our souls: the death of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels could not have purchased one soul: but God gave his only begotten Son, and none but he was a valuable price to gain souls: See how the great God doth value one poor soul!</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Consider the salvation of our souls to have been the great subject of Gods eternal thoughts and counsels: 'Tis no lesse than a blasphemous absurdity to conceive that the great God would lay out his eternal thoughts, and everlasting purposes, about the gaining of souls, were they not incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably precious in his esteem, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He hath chosen us before the foundation of the world;</hi> There you see that God did set his thoughts upon the salvation of souls, before he set his thoughts upon the Creation
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:206435:84"/> of this glorious Fabrick of the world; and for this very end doth he keep up the world, that he may save all the souls he hath chosen: Heaven and Earth cannot passe away, till all elect souls be brought in to Christ; when that is done, the world shall soon be taken down: Shall not the salvation of our souls be the great subject of our own thoughts! Oh how many are there, who scarce have one serious thought of their poor souls salvation!</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Consider how the Lord Jesus doth value our souls: though his Father sent and gave him, yet it was also his own spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous and voluntary act in giving himself for a price to redeem souls: <hi>He loved me, and gave himself for me,</hi> saith the Apostle: Surely our souls must be precious gain, that nothing but the blood of Christ could purchase them: What pains did Christ take, what pains did he endure for thy soul! he was scourged, crucified, he was buried: all that he did, all that he suffered, was for thy soul. When the Jews beheld Christ weeping over dead <hi>Lazarus, Behold,</hi> said they, <hi>how he loved him!</hi> Behold ye Christ sweating drops of blood over thy soul, bleeding over thy soul, enduring the unsupportable wrath of God for thy soul!
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:206435:84"/> Behold how he loved our souls! the great dignity of our souls is seen in the infinite dignity of the price.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Consider how precious thy soul is to the Holy Ghost: how doth he move upon the face of thy soul, dropping many precious motions to urge thee! how doth he illighten, convince, strive with thy soul! how doth he wooe thy soul! how is he grieved when thou dost quench his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions! what gifts doth he bestow upon our souls! how willing is he to enrich our souls with his graces! he is willing to lead our souls in the way to salvation, as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Nurse leads the weak child: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly our souls are marvelous profit, that the glorious Trinity have such a care of them, that each person hath his peculiar work appropriated to him, in order to our salvation: the Father electeth us in Christ, the Son redeems us, the Holy Ghost sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies us, and all to gain our souls.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Consider the manifold arguments God in his Word useth to win our souls to him: How doth God command, exhort, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, beseech us, expostulate with us! why will ye damn your souls! what precious promises to allure us to him! what ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible threatnings to drive us to him! how
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:206435:85"/> doth he draw souls with cords of love to himself! The Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how much God did value a soul: <hi>as though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christs stead to be reconciled unto God.</hi> God beseecheth you for your souls: Christ prayeth you for your souls: all his Ministers in their stead pray you to give up your souls: we beseech you by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, by the love of Christ. Can we imagine that the Most High God would thus condescend to use such beseechings and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, if our souls, and the winning of them were not of unspeakable value!</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Consider what joy and rejoycing there is in Heaven, when but one poor soul among many hundreds is gained to Christ. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.10. <hi>There is joy in the presence of the Angels of God over one sinner that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth.</hi> When Angels see a sinner mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, confessing, humbled, hating his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer evil courses, following after holinesse; for Angels know that we repent by the true fruits and effects of repentance; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce that this day is a Son begotten unto God; this day another heir of salvation; we have another fellow-servant: so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious is one soul to the Angels, that they are willing and ready to pitch their Tents
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:206435:85"/> about the soul, to guard and protect it: yea, those glorious Angels will come flying from Heaven to conduct, to carry, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the soul to Heaven.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Consider what transcendent and most glorious things God hath prepared for the entertainment of our souls: our Saviour tells us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.2. <hi>I go to prepare a place for you:</hi> I am going up to Heaven to prepare Heaven for your reception; to prepare Thrones and Crowns, and Robes and Pleasures, and Joy and Glory for you. What preparations are made for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of earthly Princes! they expect that great preparations should be made for them. Oh then what great thoughts hath the Great God of our souls, that he should make such great preparations in Heaven, to entertain our souls, when they depart hence!</p>

                        <p n="2">2. Consider how the Devil takes all the pains his wisdom, power, and strength can, to ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>n the souls of men; he walks to and fro the whole Earth that he may gain a soul; he compasseth Sea and Land to make a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selyte of Hell. The Apostle tells us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Your adversary the Devil as a roaring Lion goeth about seeking whom he may devour;</hi> he is restlesse and indefatigable, and very watchful, giving his eyes neither slumber
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:206435:86"/> nor sleep, to devour a soul: if the damned Devils were capable of joy, what triumphs would there be in Hell, when he hath gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one poor soul! we doubt not but it is some contentation to his malitious nature, when he hath devoured a soul: Can we think that the Devil would thus traverse the Earth to and fro, did not he know too well the worth of souls!</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Consider, that all the opposition he makes, is against the salvation of souls; 'tis true, he fights against God, Christ, and the Gospel, against Faith and Holinesse, but all in reference to the soul, that he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy it: he keeps men from the means of salvation, from Prayer, Word, Sacraments, that he may hinder the salvation of our souls; he warreth against nothing but our soul. As the Prophet said of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians, Isa.</hi> 13.17, That <hi>they regard neither silver nor gold:</hi> So the Devil regards not the outward comforts and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we have; he regards not our wealth, lands, honours; he fighteth not against them, but against our souls.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Consider how he makes use of all things and persons, that by them he may gain a soul to himself: there is nothing in the world but he employs it to this purpose;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:206435:87"/> riches, pleasures, honours he useth to catch souls with; yea, your near and dear rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; as he did <hi>Job</hi>'s wife, tempting him by her, to curse God and dye: and all wicked persons he makes great use of, making them to be so many tempting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils to catch souls; making them to rail, to reproach, to revile the wayes of God, that men may abhor Godlinesse, and damn their souls.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Consider what pains he takes, how he rageth when he is in fear that any soul will be converted; how doth he oppose their conversion, and endeavour all that he can to make that work to come to nought: those who are Converts do sadly feel his power and rage against the work of grace in their hearts; none more tempted than they, none more perplexed with distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting thoughts, with doubts and fears than they.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Consider, that albe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>t the Devil knows that the damnation of souls will be the aggravation of his intolerable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible torments; that God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the blood of all souls of him; yet he so prizeth a soul, that he will gain it if he call, though it will cost him dear at the last; he doth not regard his own torments,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:206435:87"/> so he may bring souls into the same tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with himself: by these arguments you see what a pretious gain our souls are.</p>

I doubt not, but we in our thoughts blame <hi>Adam,</hi> who for the having and eating a little forbidden fruit, lost Paradise; and <hi>Esau</hi> also, who for a mess of pottage sold his birthright: Thus do all they, who for the gain of the world, hazzard the loss of their inestimable souls; they purchase pebbles for pearls, dross for gold, glass for a rich jewel, their birthright for pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, Paradise for an Apple; and as <hi>Lysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi> cried out, they lose a Kingdom for a draught of water: This is the reason why Christ called the rich man <hi>Fool,</hi> Luke 12.20. <hi>Thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee:</hi> or rather, (as it is in the Margin of some Bibles) <hi>do they require thy soul:</hi> This night shall the Devils re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire thy soul, then whose shall these things be? you see that this man had gained much goods for many years; he could live upon his gains a merry and contented life for many years: you see he had wit enough for the world: no doubt
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:206435:88"/> but his neighbours commended him for a wise man, yet saith God to him, <hi>Thou fool:</hi> because he gained much goods for many supposed years to come, and lost his soul for millions of millions of ages: it is madness and folly indeed to lose the soul for ever, to gain a momentany world: <hi>Stulterum plena sunt omnia:</hi> the world is full of such fools: how many are there in every place, who mind the world, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think they have a soul to save or lose! The Apostle tells us, that man is worse then an Infidel that doth not provide for his own house; or (as it is in the Margin) for his own kindred, having means to do it: then surely, he that doth not provide for his soul, having means and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of grace and salvation, is far worse then an Infidel; he will be more inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable, and his damnation will be more intolerable.</p>

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> THe first reason to prove the truth of this Doctrine is, because there is no comparison between the soul and the gain of this world: the soul is more above the gold and silver of this world, then gold and silver is above straw and dung.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. There is no comparison between hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth: the soul of man in respect of its high extraction, is from heaven, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly: What are all the profits of the world, but from earth, earthly? the richest Mines of gold and silver lie deepest in the earth, to shew their base extraction. The soul was made to return to heaven, and it is capable of heavenly things: great pity that such a rich treasure should fall to be the portion of Devils: he is no gainer, that loseth an heavenly treasure for the gaining of an earthly.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. There is no comparison between life and death: all things desire life, and abhor death: thy soul is a living spirit, that gives life to thy body; and the continuance of it, is the continuance of thy life: all the things
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:206435:89"/> in the world are dead things, they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give life, nor continue life: <hi>Is not thy life more then meat, and thy body more then raiment? A living Dogg,</hi> saith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, is better then a dead Lion:</hi> a living Beggar is better then a dead Nobleman: surely then, a living soul, is better then a world of dead things, than thousands of gold and silver; the loss of one living soul, is more then the gain of a world of de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="3">3. There is no comparison between the gaining of that which is subject to no loss and chances, and that which is subject to a thousand chances: but thy soul, if it be gained, is not liable to be lost again; it is not exposed to Thieves, moths, rust, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, corruption, as the gain of the world is. Do we not see how riches are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, garments moth eaten, Gold and Silver cankered, and consumed with rust? God hath many wayes to deprive us of this worlds gain; either the fire shall burn it, or waters drown it, or Thieves rob us of it, or a Son shall riotously waste it, or an unfaithful Servant shall embezz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:206435:90"/> of the gain the which they have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured hard for, and ventured desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the gaining thereof. What profit is it to lose a certain soul for such uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain gain?</p>
                        <p n="4">4.

                        <p n="6">6. What comparison is there in that gain which a man must part with, and shall be separated from, (though he do his utmost to keep it) and that gain which a man shall never part from; and let men, the world, sin and Devils, and all things do their worst, yet they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to separate a man from this gain, neither here nor hereafter? Labour to gain as much as you can in this world, yet part you must, and shall with all your gain: <hi>you shall carry nothing out of the world with you:</hi> If when a man dies, and goes out of the world, his gains did go with him: if when they required the soul
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:206435:91"/> of the rich fool, they also did require his goods to go with him, and his soul should enjoy his goods, ease, pleasure, honour in another world, there were some profit in gaining the goods of the world, though the soul be lost: but now seeing when a man goeth out of the world, his gains stay behind with him, not one penny of money, or foot of Land, or Degree of Honour goes along with him, what doth he gain? but now the gain of the soul goes along with a man into the world to come; this lives and dies and remains with him to eternity: the worldly gainer when he dies, cries out, Now I lose all, and part with all; but the soul-gainer saith, Now I gain, and shall possess all things.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Consider, For what use the gain of the one and of the other is: you shall see that he gains nothing that gaineth the world with the loss of his soul: when a man hath gained the whole world, what doth it serve for? only for the back to cloathe it gorgeously, and the belly to feed it delicately: If there were many worlds for a man to gain, yet he hath but one back and belly to cloath, and feed for a while; and further, he that gaineth all, can use them no more then to see
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:206435:91"/> them with his eyes, and keep them in his hands tiil he dies: this is the utmost gain of the greatest gainer in the world: But now the gain of the soul is for higher and more noble and everlasting use: the soul is to enjoy God and heaven, and God and heaven are to enjoy the soul: the soul will make use of God for unspeakable and eternal happiness, and God will make use of the soul that is gained to him to praise and serve him eternally.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Consider these two particulars.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That man is no gainer at last, that shall repent of his gain that he hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: ye that are greedy of this worlds gain, labour tooth and nail for it; spend your time, strength and life for the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: let it be unto thee according to the desire of thy covetous and worldly heart; yet know that a little before thy death, or within a few hours after thy death, thou shalt repent of all thy labour and gains: thou shalt cry out in the language of the damned souls; O that I had never been rich!

I shall therefore lay down these particulars.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. We must labour, and may employ our heads and hands to procure the things of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:206435:93"/> this life: diligence in our particular Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, is serving of God: idlenesse is a sin, and a root of more sins: God would have <hi>Adam</hi> labour in the state of Innocency: Paradise was not only a Garden of delight for <hi>Adam</hi> to take his pleasure in, but of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour also to employ himself therein.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. We may receive the gain of the world, as the blessing of diligence in our Callings, and as precious fruit dropping from the promises of the things of this life: <hi>Abraham</hi>'s riches did not hinder the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his soul.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Though we may receive the gain of the world, and have an eye to it, yet it is not the thing we must chiefly respect; the gain that must be in our eye, thoughts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, desires, must be the salvation of our souls. This is the undoing of many souls, that men have an eye more to the gain of the world, than to the saving of their souls; and look wholly after out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gain, and never look after the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their souls.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. In labouring for worldly gain, let your moderation be known to all men; immoderate desires and labours after out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gain are the ruine of precious souls; when men have so much businesse in the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:206435:93"/> world, that they will spare no time to save their souls, and think that time lost that is spent in soul-work: when men drown themselves in the cares of the world, and in worldly labours, they drown their souls in perdition and destruction.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. You may labour for worldly gain, but yet in subordination to the gain of the soul; first, seek the salvation of your souls, then gain: but men put off the great work of salvation to the last, and so lose their souls; as the foolish Virgins put off seeking Oyl to the last, and so lost their souls.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Look that what you gain be justly gotten: un just gain doth not only bring a curse upon a mans estate, but also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction on his soul: What shall it profit a man, if he gain much by iniquity, and damn his soul? Men are not damned for gaining, but for gaining profits unjustly; their M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="7">7. If gain flow in upon you, beware of setting your hearts on it: <hi>Love not the world, nor the things of the world,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15. Men may have them, but must not love them: it is <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:206435:94"/> men: where the love of the world pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, all love to Gods and mens own souls abates in them.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. We must so enjoy the gain of the world, that if Christ and his Gospel call us to deny, to forsake it, we must be willing to cast all away, and to cleave to Christ: if we gain, and keep the whole world, and reject Christ, his Gospel, and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, we shall be no gainers at last: sometimes Christ and the world, the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and the world, a good conscience and the world cometh in competition; to gain the world in such a juncture of time, may prove the loss of your immortal souls: of such, this in my Text is principally spoken; <hi>What shall it profit a man, &amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>THe third Proposition is, That the loss of the soul is the loss of losses.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. There is no undoing loss but this loss: a man is not undone that loseth his prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, riches, liberty, life, but he that loseth his soul: when death sends the body
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:206435:94"/> to the grave, and the soul to Hell, then a man is undone, and never till then, though like <hi>Job</hi> he lose all, and be driven from a Palace to lye on a dunghill.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Because 'tis an universal loss, a loss of all that is good; other losses are but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular losses: if a man lose his soul, his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is lost with his soul; he loseth God, Christ, Glory, Heaven, and Blessedness: the loss of the soul is nothing else but a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the soul from God, from Christ, from Heaven: <hi>poena damni,</hi> this punishment of loss is the worst part of damnation: the loss of God and of Christ, is more than the loss of our souls: in losing God, we lose an infinite good: our soul is more worth than a world; but God is worth more than thousands of millions of worlds. What shall it profit a man to gain the whole world, and lose God? What shall a man give in exchange for God, for Christ, for Heaven? were it only the loss of our souls, it were grievous; but it is the loss of our God also which makes it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible loss.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It is an irrecoverable loss: other losses may be made up again: A man may lose his goods, children, health, and make them up again, as <hi>Job</hi> did, who recovered
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:206435:95"/> all his losses: he was richer in goods, had a numerous issue: he had all what he lost by <hi>Caldeans, Sabeans,</hi> wind, fire and Devils, made up again: but a lost soul can never be recovered again, <hi>nec prece nec pretio;</hi> once cast into Hell, and for ever cast into Hell. What the Psalmist saith of life, is as true of the soul. <hi>Psal.</hi> 49.7. <hi>None of them can by any means redeem his Brother, nor give God a ransome for him: the redemption of the soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever.</hi> The very Heathen could say, <hi>ab in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feris nulla redemptio,</hi> from Hell there is no redemption. Some have lost their lives, and Christ hath restored them again; but never did he, never will he restore a lost soul: he dyed once, and he will dye no more to save souls; he must be crucified again to save a damned soul. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> speaks truth in saying, That desperation is part of the torments of the damned, to be in Hell torments without the least hopes of redemption.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. There is no gain equivalent to repair the loss of the soul: we may lose other things, yet gain something that my be equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to what we have lost: Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence makes up the loss of goods with the gain of grace, which is equivalent;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:206435:95"/> yea, of far more value than the goods of the world: we may lose our lives; God makes up the loss of life it self, with life eternal; yea, God hath promised to repair our losses an hundred-fold. <hi>Mark</hi> 10.29, 30. <hi>Verily I say unto you, there is no man that hath left Houses, or Brethren, or Sisters, or Father, or Mother, or Children, or Lands, for my sake and the Gospel, but he shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an hundred-fold now in this life, and in the world to come life eternal.</hi> Grace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, assurance of Gods favour, is an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred-fold better than all this worlds goods, and eternal life is a thousand-fold bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the whole world; but if we lose our souls, there is no gain to be had equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to our souls: <hi>What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</hi> that is, What thing is there that is equivalent to a soul? What are all the treasures in the world to our souls? yea millions of worlds are a most disproportionable recompence to a lost soul.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Because the loss of our souls is not a bare privation, and loss of it which is no other than annihilation, turning the soul into nothing: it were happy for men, if their souls might cease to be when they are lost: no Being is better than a miserable
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:206435:96"/> Beeing: it were an happiness if Rocks and Mountains could crush the wicked, that they should never be again: it were well for Atheists that it were according to their thoughts, that there were no God, no Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, no Hell; but the loss of their souls is the damnation of their souls to Hell; it is Gods adjudging our souls to burn in flames of fire; every lost soul findeth Hell; men gain the place of torment by the loss of their souls: the soul of the rich glutton is in Hell torments; the Devils lost Heaven, and gained Hell; when men lose their souls, they lose God, and enjoy Devils; they lose Heaven, and gain Hell: they lose joy and happiness, and gain inexpressible and unsupportable torments.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. 'Tis an eternal loss: eternity makes it to be the loss of losses; were it but for a time, were it but for a thousand years, as <hi>Origen</hi> fondly and impiously held; this length of time would make the loss of souls great and considerable. Could a man be assured, that he should for some scores of years endure the terrible pains of the Stone and Gout, with any tormenting disease, it would make his stout spirit shrink and quake; but now eternity makes an evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite: the loss of a soul being eternal,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:206435:96"/> makes the loss infinite: eternal duration of torments, is the Hell of Hells. Were it possible to us to hear what yellings and howlings a damned loft soul makes, you might hear these sad complaints: Oh when shall I be delivered? what never! Must I be tormented as I am for ever? Oh that I had never been born! Oh that God would make my soul cease to be! Oh that I might not be at all! I would give all the world, had I it, not that I might be happy, but that I might not be at all: but wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed creature that I am, I must for ever burn in Hell: this word <hi>for ever, and for ever,</hi> tormenteth the soul as much as the fire doth; it gnaweth the conscience as cruelly as the worm doth. <hi>Nulla major ac pejor nors, quum ibi non moritur mors:</hi> no death is more terrible than an ever-living death, saith St. <hi>Augustine.</hi>

                           <p>BEfore I make Application, I will lay down this Inference or Corollary, hence we may infer, That our souls are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal; otherwise there were no force in our Saviours arguments, encouraging us to self-denyal, and losing of life, and despising the gains and profits of the world: for if our souls were corruptible, like the souls of Beasts, then let us seek our selves, throw away the Cross, let us save this present life, and let us gain the world, and never mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our souls no more than do the Beasts that perish: What necessity is there of professing any Religion, of being holy? let us rather take up this resolution, and put it in pract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:206435:97"/> Therefore our Saviour, to dash these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious resolutions, and to make us willing to lose all, to leave all, to suffer all things, to despise the world, tells us of saving life by losing it. (1.) Of gaining eternal life by losing a temporal life: therefore the soul must needs live after its departure from the body; and that the gain of the whole world is nothing to the loss of our souls; therefore the soul must abide for ever in weal or woe; for if our souls live not alwayes, there were no losing of them. I will therefore by some Arguments from Scripture, and by other Arguments, prove the immortality of the soul. Some deny the immortality of it; and the generality of men live as practical Mortalists, as if their souls were mortal; and did we firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the immortality of our souls, men would have greater care, and give more diligence to save their souls, than they do; men would prize their souls above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand worlds of mortal and perishing trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; but alas few believe it!</p>

To profane wicked persons: lose not your invaluable souls for a base lust: St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>For meat destroy not the work of God,</hi> Rom. 14.15. let none of us for a lust destroy our souls, the choycest of Gods works: destroy it not for drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, for swearing, for uncleanness: our hearts would dissolve into tears, did we seriously consider how many men hazzard their immortal souls for the love and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of some lust or other, by which many do not gain the world, but lose the very gains of the world, in satisfying some damning lusts: swearers gain nothing by their oaths, yet lose their soul: Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:206435:102"/> lose their gain, and their souls also: many lusts there are which consume mens estates, and bring everlasting destruction on their souls.</p>

Your lusts pollute and defile your souls, and do put your souls into an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter incapacity of salvation, and fit the soul for destruct on. No unclean thing shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; no unclean soul shall be saved: Hell is the proper place and receptacle of unclean spirits; the very Devils shall as soon enter into heaven as an unclean soul: your souls must be washed in the blood of Christ, and bathed in the laver of regeneration, before they can enter into heaven.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Your souls cannot but be lost, if you love any lust; for God cannot but abhor and hate your souls wallowing in filthy lusts: God cannot delight in you, will not shew you any redeeming and saving mercy; they are your lusts that make the Almighty God, the severe Judge of all souls to be an enemy to you; if God be an enemy, thy soul cannot escape the damnation of Hell.</p>

Oh that we could but seriously think, how angry God and Christ is, to see men value a lust above a soul for which Christ died; this is tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling under foot the blood of Christ, and the blood of our souls also.

It is worldly gain that choaks the seed of the word which is able to save your souls: as Christ whipt out of the Temple the buyers and sellers, so the world comes in and casts out all saving counsel of the word; yea when the word comes in a convincing way, the world choaks all those convictions; and when the word of God stirs up any good resolutions in the soul, the world choaks them, and makes men break through all, and all this is to the utter undoing of the pretious souls; choak the word, and you choak your souls; choak the word, and you choak your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.</p>

                           <p n="2">II. Consider what helps and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges God hath graciously given us for the winning of our souls, which he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to thousands of people in the world, whose souls are as pretious as ours, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and as capable of grace and glory as ours, and yet want these helps and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:206435:108"/> which we have for the salvation of our souls.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. We have a day of salvation to work it out, which they have not: they have a day of patience, but not a day of grace and salvation as we have.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. We have Sabbath dayes which are the Mercat-dayes, on which we may buy without money all necessary provision for our souls: <hi>The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath;</hi> it was made for the soul, the chiefest part of man; that a man might have one entire day to work for the profit of his soul: 'Tis a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation to consider how many stand idle in the Mercat all the day long, and slight and profane this Mercat-day.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. God hath provided for us pretious ordinances, which are the means of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>the wells of salvation,</hi> as the Prophet calls them, out of which our souls may draw and drink salvation; they are as <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> ladder, by which Christ descendeth from heaven to our souls: we ascend to heaven where Christ is; by prayer, we send to heaven for salvation: by hearing the word, we hear from heaven the things of salvation; the Sacraments are seals seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing salvation to believing souls: hence the

                           <p n="4">4. We have Ministers whose duty is to watch over our souls, whose work and crown is to convert our souls: they are to study, pray, preach, write, and labour and sweat for the salvation of our souls, who are earthly Angels to convey our souls to Christ, and so to salvation, as the heavenly Angels shall convey them from our bodies to heaven: oh how many thousands of pretious souls do want such Instruments of salvation!</p>
                           <p n="3">III. Consider that the work of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not so full of toyl and labour, and vexation of mind and body, as the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to win the profits of the world is: how full are their heads of cares, their hands of work, who labour to gain the world! now the working out of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in it self considered, is easie, sweet, full of delight; it is only the corruption of our hearts makes it tedious and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some: what sweetnesse the souls of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers do find, that others may find, would they give up themselves to the work, to praying, hearing the word, meditating on God, Christ, and heaven, to believing,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:206435:109"/> to mortifying their lusts; there is no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity nor vexation of spirit in these exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, they are sweeter then the hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb: they are our carnal lusts that make us to disrelish these things as bitter: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider with your selves, there is no drudgery nor toyl in praying continually for salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in attending on the Ministry of the word of salvation in season and out of season.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. Consider what offers of Salvation God makes to us, which he denieth to thousands of pretious souls in the world: we need not compass Sea and Land for our Souls, as Merchants do to win the profi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:206435:110"/> of Salvation is nigh thee, it is in thy mouth, it is in thine ear:</hi> oh therefore, how shall we escape if we neglect Salvation thus of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered!</p>
                           <p n="5">V. Consider how God is ready and hath promised to bless the means of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them that shall diligently make use thereof: he is ready to work in us both to will and to do; he is ready to give faith, repentance, grace, every thing that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental and preparative to the Salvation of our Souls. God, Christ, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghost will be co-workers with us, if we will put our hands to this plough; never did any man diligently attend the work of the Salvation of his Soul, but he found God blessing the labour of his hands to him; never did any seek him in vain, never did any come to Christ, and was rejected.</p>
                           <p n="6">VI. Consider at what easie rate we may purchase Salvation; if the soul be lost, then nothing can be given in exchange for the soul: but now God requires us to give away our lusts in exchange for the salvation of our souls: sell all thy lusts and give them away, and thou shalt have sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: can there be an easier and cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er price given for salvation? who will not give in exchange pebbles for diamonds,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:206435:110"/> dirt and dung for gold? he that purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth gold by setting go dung, he purchaseth gold at an easie rate: this easie and low price God expecteth we should give for the saving our souls: let go thy lusts, thy soul shall be saved: the best thing we can part with, is but our moral righteousnesse, which is but dung and drosse; part with it, here is Christ and salvation: let us be judges how deservedly do men eternally perish, who will not give their sins away in exchange for their souls; and too many such there are in the world.</p>

There is much praying, much hearing, meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, humiliation, examination, much mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, much striving with our hearts, against our lusts, devils, the world; a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking of all sin, yea an universal obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to all Gods commands before we can be saved: a few duties will not do the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:206435:111"/> work, nor diligence for a fit, nor leaving a few sins, but we must serve God in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and holiness all the dayes of our lives: we must pray continually, we must persevere to the end in all good, if we will be saved; therefore much time is required for this work.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As the work we have to do is great and much, so the time alloted us for this work of salvation is very short; we have but as it were a day to work for eternity. Our time is not only short, but swift; how do every one of us hasten to our graves and eternal states? 'tis not only short and swift, but uncertain; we know not the day nor the hour when our souls shall be required: it may be this night, it may be this week; our times are known only to God. <hi>Tecum cogita, cùm exeas potes nòn redire; cum redeas potes nòn exire,</hi> said <hi>Seneca.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> Oh therefore, what necessity is laid upon us to redeem time, as the Apostle exhorts us, to redeem it from our labours, pleasures, profits and sleep, to spend it in working out the salvation of our souls! But oh how do the generality of men take away time from the soul, to employ it in getting gain! many there are who grudge their so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:206435:112"/> in a day, and bestow more time and labour in one year on the profits of the world, then they do all their life long in soul-work! how many put off this work till they have but few hours to live, and not any bodily strength to do the least work of salvation!</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Consider what slow work-men we are in this great work of salvation of our souls: our hearts are naturally sluggish, yea naturally opposite to our own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and to the means tending to obtain it: the most holy man is too slothful in this great work; the best men have much ado to keep their hearts in holy diligence in the work of saving their souls: when they find their spirits most willing, they alwayes find the flesh very weak and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, so that they cannot do the things they would, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. therefore we had need to take as much time as we can, to bestow on the winning of our souls.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Consider how God doth earnestly call upon us to work out our salvation, to give diligence to make our calling to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation sure to us: <hi>work while it is day</hi> saith Christ, <hi>the night is coming, when no man can work. To day, while it is called to day, harden not your hearts,</hi> saith the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:206435:112"/> Holy Ghost, <hi>Now is the time, now is the day of salvation.</hi> God would not have us to delay till the next minute; but even while it is called <hi>Now,</hi> we should work out our salvation: never did any Master call upon his servants more earnestly to do any thing, than God calls upon us to save our souls. The <hi>Rabbin</hi> said, <hi>Nemo est cui non fit hora.</hi> Every man hath his hour: he who overslips it, may never meet with the like hour again. Oh therefore begin this work now without delay: we all resolve to bestow some time on our souls; why not <hi>this now?</hi> we are sure of this time, we are not certain of to morrow; by to morrow this time thou maist be in thy grave, or in bell. At death we will desire longer time for our souls; tis just with God to deny it then, because we neglect and mispend our present time. When <hi>Apelles</hi> was asked, why he was so long and accurate in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a picture, he answered <hi>Aeternitati pingo,</hi> I paint to Eternity. What need have we to be long and accurate in soul-work, for we work to eternity! we must pray much, for we pray to eternity; we must hear and meditate much, we hear and meditate to eternity; we must be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry accurate in our conversations, for we
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:206435:113"/> walk to eternity; our immortal souls must be in weal or woe to eternity.</p>

                        <p>IT should learn us all in perillous times of the Church, to take more care of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our souls before all things whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; let not the fear of losing our estates, liberties, lives, make us expose our souls to losing or saving them. Keep thy soul with all diligence, <hi>Prov</hi> 4.23. if soul or estate must go, keep thy soul with all diligence, let estate go: if thy soul or relations, if thy soul or honours, if thy soul or life must go, be sure to keep thy soul, secure that from losing; let all things go, how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious soever and dear they are to thee, yet let them go: save the Jewel, whatever becometh of the Cabinet; oh save this peerless Jewel, thine immortal soul, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever becomes of thy name, goods, lands, livings, wife, children, body, life and all. If your houses be on fire, you will strive to save your selves, your children, your plate, your money, your evidences, let the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:206435:113"/> lumber be burnt: if the conscience doth not suffer shipwrack, is is no matter if the ship be split. <hi>Joseph my son is yet alive, it is enough,</hi> said <hi>Jacob:</hi> my soul is safe, my conscience is preserved, it is enough; I have enough, may a Christian say in his greatest losses for Christ and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>
                        <p>There is great reason why we should especially look to the salvation of our souls.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Because if we save the soul, we save all from being lost; and if the soul be lost all is lost, and we are undone for ever and ever; if the soul be saved, we shall have a good God, a good Saviour, a good Kingdom, we shall have those immense treasures of Goodness which God hath prepared in Heaven; but if the soul be lost, we lose a good God, and a good Kingdom.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Because there are things to be given in exchange for other things we lose; but if the soul be lost, what shall we give in exchange for our souls? God can, God will repair all our losses for Christ an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold: he will give you grace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, support, in exchange for your lost <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>IS the salvation of souls the best gain, and the loss of souls the saddest loss? hence let us be exhorted to take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion of the souls of others, to use our best indeavours in our stations to promote the salvation of the souls of others: let Husbands and Wives promote the salvation of one anothers souls. God, Christ, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, do take pity on our souls, let us also
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:206435:114"/> pity them: <hi>He that winneth souls, is wise,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon.

Yea, that man that pitieth his own soul, will pity the souls of others; he that endeavours his own salvation, will promote the salvation of others; he that is afraid of the fire of Hell, will, as St. <hi>Jude</hi> saith, pull others out of the fire: Men have not compassion of the souls of others, that are regardless of their own souls: he that considereth what the loss of a soul is, cannot but do what he can to save souls. Oh therefore let us be perswaded to pray for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers souls conversion and salvation: let us counsel one another to save one anothers souls: let us reprove one another, that we may save one anothers souls; let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke one another to holiness: let us exhort one another; Come, let us go unto the house of the Lord, he will teach us the way to salvation: If this be our duty, where then shall those men appear, that promote one anothers souls damnation, by evil counsels, by evil examples, by tempting one another to sin, by encouraging one another in evil, by keeping vain and evil company! how will these men curse one

                           <p>In the Parable there are these observable things.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Gods great favour to some, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Trees planted in a Vineyard.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. His complaint of the abuse of this his special favour, threatning to destroy them.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. His longer forbearance toward them, and continuance of the means of conversion among them a little longer.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. His final determination in case men repent not.</p>
                           <p>I will now lay open the sense of the words of this Parable, and then lay before you the chief points contained in it.</p>
                           <p>A certain man.] that is, God; Christ condescending to the capacity of his hearers, compareth the great God to a man that is an owner of a Vineyard.</p>
                           <p>By <hi>the Vineyard,</hi> understand the Church in general; and every Congregation ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in the name of Christ, wherein the Means and Ordinances of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are dispensed: the Church is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently compared to a Vineyard, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 80.8. <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.1.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Because all men delight in their Vineyards: so doth God in his Church: <hi>here,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>will I delight to dwell:</hi> it is Gods pleasant walk, <hi>I will walk in them.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">
                              <pb n="192" facs="tcp:206435:121"/>2. Because a Vineyard is the rich posse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion of men: Kings delight in planting Vineyards: of old Vineyards were Kingly possessions: so the Church is Gods por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the lot of his inheritance; it is of his planting in the earth.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Because men bestow care and cost on Vineyards: so God bestows his costly things on the Church; all his care is for his Church: he no more regardeth Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions where he hath no Church, than men regard waste howling wildernesses.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Because in Vineyards men plant the choicest Trees, as Vines, or Figg-trees: it is an effect of special favour to such men whom God placeth in his Church under the means of salvation: all other men without the Church are as briars and thorns, and trees standing in a barren wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, fit for no use, but fuel for fire.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. A Vineyard is profitable to men: so is the Church (as I may so speak) to God: he reaps no fruit from any parts of the world, but from his Church: from hence he gathereth Grapes and Figgs: here he hath the fruits of faith and holiness: in the Church only God is served.</p>

Because no Tree is more fruitful than it: it is usual in those Countries for Figg-trees to bring forth fruit sooner than other Trees, <hi>viz.</hi> the first year they are planted: and it is observed, that if it bring not forth fruit the second or third year, then there is no hope: conversion is usually wrought in the beginning of enjoying the preaching of the Gospel; conversion in old age is very rare: if men bring not forth fruit
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:206435:122"/> after the enjoyment of the word for some years, I dare not say that there is no hope, but there is but small hopes of them.</p>
                           <p n="3">3.

                           <p>Others understand it only of the three years wherein Christ preached to them, and confirmed his doctrine with glorious miracles; and do think that this Parable was spoken in the beginning of his fourth year.</p>
                           <p>They who apply it to all persons within the Church, understand by the three years, the threefold age of man, his youth, his manhood, and his old age: God comes to us in the dayes of our youth, seeking our repentance, but finds none; in the day of our middle age, and finds none; in the day of our old age, and finds none.</p>
                           <p>But letting pass these and other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations: we are to understand by three years all that space of time that we enjoy the means of grace, be it longer or shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

It is a sad observation that some Divines make from these words: that God usually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth those that are converted within three years after he hath sent the powerful Ministry among them: but this is rather their severe opinion, then a solid do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:206435:123"/> of the Word, whose whole labour Christ useth in dressing his Vineyard, in planting and watering the trees, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to repentance; hence they are called co-workers with God.</p>
                           <p>Now said he to the dresser of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard concerning the fruitless figtree,

                           <p>Unfruitful trees are burdens in a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard: they take up the room of trees, which (if planted in the Vineyard) would bring forth fruits of repentance: they spoil other trees, and make them to become barren.

                           <p>Here Christ mediateth for them: Lord; Yet shew more rich patience and forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: destroy it not presently, but wait one year more for its repentance.</p>

                           <p>Here Christ condescendeth to mean ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, by comparing the continuance of the means of grace and salvation, to dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dunging: alluding to Vine-dressers and husbandmen, who dig and open the earth about the root of the tree, and dung it to make it to bear fruit. Thus Christ saith, that his Ministers shall use their best skill and labour to bring impenitent persons to repentance; they shall still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite, exhort, perswade them to repent; they shall lay promises and threatnings to them to provoke them to fruitfulness.

                           <p>So then in this Parable, we see Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and severity contending about impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent sinners: justice is enraged against them, and would destroy them, but mercy holds her hand, till triall be made to the full whether they will repent.</p>

If thou art a figtree planted in his Vineyard, he expects to gather figs from thee; if God hath bestowed this special favour on thee, as to admit thee into his Church, to bring thee under the Gospel and all ordinances of grace, he expecteth thy obedience to the Gospel, thy repentance at the preaching of the Gospel, that thou shouldest bring forth
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:206435:126"/> fruits meet for repentance: Gods coming and seeking fruit,<note place="margin">Maldonat. in loc.</note> is, (as <hi>Maldonat</hi> rightly Paraphraseth it) his turning his eyes this way and that way to behold who repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, who believeth.</p>
                        <p>For proof of this point, read Isa. 5.1, 2. <hi>Now will I sing to my well beloved a song of my beloved touching his Vineyard: my well beloved hath a Vineyard in a very fruitful hill.</hi> The Prophet calls Christ his well beloved: I will sing to my beloved a song of my beloved, that is, a song that Christ his best beloved did put into his mouth to sing: let us see the matter of his song — <hi>my Beloved hath a Vineyard in a very fruitful hill:</hi> that is, Christ hath planted his Church in an excellent place, a fruitful soil, hath given her powerful means to enable her to bear fruit. <hi>And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest Vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a Winepress therein:</hi> By these Rhetorical terms, the Prophet shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Gods wonderful care for his Church and people, for their Salvation; he useth all means to make men in his Church fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and removeth what may hinder fruit-bearing. <hi>And he locked that it should bring
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:206435:126"/> forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</hi> That is, Christ expected to gather faith, repentance, holiness; but instead of pretious grapes, it brought forth stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grapes, as the Hebrew word signifies: instead of faith, it brough forth infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, distrust; instead of holiness, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wickedness; instead of obedience all manner of disobedience: But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his expectation, God sees nothing but drunkenness, swearing, lying, oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as if they were trees planted in a wast howling wilderness, and not in a fruitful Vineyard; as if they were men living among Cannibals and Pagans, where no means of Grace is; and not in the Church where the Gospel of faith and holiness is Preached.</p>

                           <p>COnsider we two things by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this point.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. God expects the same fruits for kind, as men expect; from Vines Grapes; from Fig trees Figs; and from what seed they sow in their fields, the same grain, as from
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:206435:127"/> wheat they expect wheat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So God expecteth fruit answerable to the seed he soweth: if men have no more then natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral means given them, God expecteth such fruit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, 21. God expecteth from Pagans and Infidels that they should give that glory and service to his Infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty according to that knowledge they have of him from the law of nature in their consciences, and the book of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wherein are visibly written the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible attributes and properties of God: he expects natural worship from natural means of knowledge. But from us who are in the Vineyard of the Church, and have an holy Gospel, holy means, holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, God expecteth the fruits of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and righteousness; God expecteth faith, and fruits meet for faith from every one of us who have the word of faith preached; he expects repentance from us who are by the Gospel called to repentance: if he expects answerable fruit to his cost bestowed on trees in an howling wilderness from Pagans, then much more from trees planted in Paradise, from all men planted in his Church.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. God expects fruits proportionable to the means of grace he bestows upon men: where much is given, much is required:
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:206435:127"/> as in the Parable God required double where two talents were given, and fivefold where five talents were given: the more talents any man hath, the more profit is expected from him: and as the Apostle saith in another case, <hi>He that soweth spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly shall reap sparingly:</hi> So where God soweth sparingly, he will reap sparingly, but reap he will: have we the means in more power, for longer continuance then others? God expecteth more faith, more repentance, more knowledge, more holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness then from others: the more Sabbaths you have, the more Sermons you hear, more fruits are expected from you: the longer you live under converting and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying means, the more God expects you should abound in every good work. Men do expect that trees of longest standing in their Orchards, should be taller, big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and more fruitful, then trees newly planted: how sharply doth the Apostle reprove the Hebrews, because their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was not proportionable to their time and means of grace! <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. <hi>For the time ye ought to be teachers, but ye have need one teach you, which be the first princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Oracles of God;</hi> as who should say, For the time that ye have heard the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:206435:128"/> Gospel, and enjoyed all saving means, ye ought to be as knowing as your teachers are; but alas, you need to be taught the A. B. C. of Christianity.</p>

                           <p n="2">2. COnversion and grace is here called fruit: it is a Metaphor frequently used by the Holy Ghost; in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. Graces are called the fruits of the spirit, because they are the native and noble off-spring of the spirit of God in us: it is called <hi>the fruit of righteousness,</hi> Jam. 3.18. and Heb. 12.11. and believers are called <hi>trees of righteousness.</hi> The reasons are these;</p>

                           <p n="3">3. Because repentance is as pretious to God as fruit is to men. <hi>The Husbandman <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           <p n="4">4. Because repentance and all graces are the blessing of God upon the means of grace, as the fruits of the earth are his blessing of mans labour; men may plow and sow, dig and dung, plant and water, but the whole increase is of God: men cannot make a tree to bring forth one fig, nor a field to bear one grain of corn: the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> calleth the fruits of the earth <hi>the blessing of God,</hi> Malach. 3.10. even so is the conversion of a sinner the blessing of God on the means of grace: we pray and preach: you hear and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate; but that you convert and believe, it is of God only. <hi>Paul</hi> planteth, yet he is nothing; <hi>Apollos</hi> watereth, yet he is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but God is all in all that gives the increase; he giveth faith, he giveth repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: it is he that makes men that are by nature thistles and thorns, to be by grace vines and figg trees, to bring forth grapes and figs, faith and holiness.</p>

                              <pb n="209" facs="tcp:206435:129"/>5.

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>1</label> THE first reason why God expecteth fruit is, because there is all equity that he should expect fruit from us whom he hath planted in this Vineyard of his Church where he dwells, for which he is so careful, on which he bestows his choice favours, the Ordinances of grace, and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:206435:130"/> means of conversion, which distinguisheth us from all people in the whole world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides: shall men expect fruit from trees which they plant in their gardens, and fruit from the fields they plough and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure? and shall not God expect from those men pretious fruit, whom he plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, watereth, manureth, whom he warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the beams of the Sun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and watereth with dew from heaven?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Because what God doth in his Church and for his Church, is not in vain; which were in vain, did not he expect fruit an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to care, cost, and pains. Can we imagine that God would have a Vineyard, a Church in the world, appoint such power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means and Ordinances, as the Word and Sacraments, that he would set up a Ministery in his Church, to preach re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, to call to repentance, to turn men from sin and Satan, and lay such a dreadful charge on the subordinate Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressers, the Ministers to Preach the Word in season and out of season? would God do all this for no end? doubtless, the only design of God in planting a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and setting Trees in it, in all these Ordinances, is that he may gather fruit
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:206435:130"/> from us, even the fruit of righteousness and holiness. If God did not expect such fruit from men in his Church, he would have had no Church, no Ordinance, no Ministery in the world; the whole world should have been a barren wilderness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and all the men in the world should have been but briars and thorns, cursed trees.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. As he is the great God and our Lord, he may expect duty from us: it is your duty to turn to God, to repent, to believe, to bring forth fruits of holiness: a Master may expect se vice from a servant, much more may the Lord; especially conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that he hath afforded us such graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous helps and means to enable us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form duty, to bring forth fruit: There is a necessity laid upon millions in the world to repent and turn to God, that never shall be trees of righteousness, because they have not the means of grace; they are trees standing in a wilderness: the same necessity is upon us to bring forth fruits to God, and he hath given us fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means; he may in justice require these pretious fruits of every one of us; and know that he doth require them of us:
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:206435:131"/> and woe to us if we bring not forth fruit meet for repentance.</p>

God hath come seeking fruit from you: God doth come to day, this hour, this very minute seeking fruit. Oh do ye now answer Gods expectation, let him find the fruit of repentance on you: Oh do not frustrate Gods expectation any more: consider ye, that the greatest benefit of your bearing fruit to God will be yours. It is no advantage to God; he is infinitely happy without your fruit, it is your souls benefit: let God gather fruit from you, and then you shall reap life everlasting; this will be the fruit of your fruit to God. Let it be matter of shame and grief to you, because of your unfruitfulness under such means of

                        <p>IN handling this Doctrine, I shall first lay down some Propositions by way of Explication, that none may deceive themselves, thinking they bear fruit, when indeed they bring forth no fruit at all: then I shall shew the causes of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulness, why God finds none in them.</p>
                        <p>

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Propos. </seg>1</label> The first Proposition is, that God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth nothing to be fruit, but what is true, right and good; it must be true faith, true repentance, true holiness; if thy faith be not saving faith, it is no faith; if thy repentance be not godly, it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: if thy love be not unfeigned, and thy obedience be not sincere, it is not the fruit of love nor of obedience; if those graces thou thinkest thy self to have, be not the noble and the royal off-spring of the Spirit of God in thee, thy graces are not graces. Thy temperance, thy so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, thy bounty and charity to the poor, if they proceed not from the spirit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, is no fruit at all; they are but the Apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> beautiful to the eye, but all rottenness within; all the good that grows on an unregenerate man, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> called <hi>splendida peccata,</hi> glittering sins.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:206435:133"/> Hence it is that the Scripture calls upon us to bring forth fruits meet for repentance; that is, they must be agreeable to true saving repentance; otherwise they are none at all in Gods account: God finds no fruit, where he finds no truth of grace. <hi>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit</hi> saith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; our fruit must be good, pleasing, grateful to God, or else it is no fruit; wild grapes are no fruit at all.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. What if God find on thee the fair blossoms of external righteousness with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inward holiness? it is no fruit in Gods account; the Pharisees brought forth such blossoms, yet saith <hi>John</hi> to them, bring forth fruits meet for repentance; God expects better fruit: see we not in nature, that many trees bring forth blossoms, yet bring no fruit at all?</p>

                           <pb n="218" facs="tcp:206435:134"/>3. Again, What if God findeth the fruits of religious duties? yet without faith and holiness this is no fruit in Gods account. A man full of religious duties without true grace, is a figg-tree full of leaves, without fruit. Albeit it be most true, that he that brings forth true grace, aboundeth in all religious duties, there is no tree that bringeth forth fruit without leaves, but many bring forth leaves without fruit.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. What if God find on men some good desires, motions, purposes, some affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to godliness? if these grow not into act, God finds no fruit on such: good affections may be called buds, but buds are no fruits: in nature we find many trees abound with buds in the spring time, yet bring forth no fruit at all in the time of fruit-bearing: buds are frequently nipt with the frost, and so die; even so it is with many men, they may abound with good motions, good affections, good purposes, but they die, and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: God finds no fruit on them.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Admit God cometh, and findeth all these growing on a man; he bears leaves of profession, blossoms of external righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and is full of good affections:
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:206435:134"/> as in nature, fruit hearing Trees bear all these; yet if God finds no faith in his heart, no sound repentance, no sincere obedience, this man is a barren figg-tree in the Lords Vineyard, whom he will cut down; for we must bring forth that very fruit which God requireth, or we bear not at all. God will not be put off with leaves and blossoms: Oh it is pitty that such men should be fuel for the fire of hell, yet they shall be: and if God will do this to these green trees, what will he do to the dry trees?</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Sheweth whence it is, and what are the causes why God finds none in them.</head>
                        <p>HEre let me speak to you what God himself speaks to such fruitless men, Isa. 5.3, 4. <hi>Now then ye inhabitants of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and ye men of</hi> Judah <hi>judge I pray you between me and my Vineyard:</hi> here God refers the matter to be judged of even by those of whom he complaineth: <hi>What is to be done more to my Vineyard which I have not done to it?</hi> Consider and judge whether I am in fault or you, that ye are so unfruitful: judge whether I have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected any means of making you fruitful. God doth and will appeal to all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, to judge between him and us who is in fault. I may thus paraphrase on the words; Ye inhabitants of <hi>Walsall,</hi> and ye men of this Congregation, judge I pray you, between God and your selves, who is in fault, that so much drunkenness, swearing, Sabbath-breaking, cursing, lying, oppression, fornication abounds among us; you may and will find that God is in no fault; but you are in the only fault
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:206435:136"/> that he finds no fruit on you; that he finds no faith, no repentance, no holiness on you: that he finds such wild grapes, such stinking fruit growing on you, and abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in you. I will first shew that God is not in fault, nor are Ministers in the fault; but we our selves are only in fault.</p>
                        <p>That God is not in fault, will appear if we consider these particulars.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. God hath planted us in his Church a fat and fruitful soil: all the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Church is a barren heath, an howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wilderness, a place of salt-pits: had God lest us to stand in the barren heath of Paganism, we should have some excuse for our selves; but that God hath called us out from thence, and planted us in his own garden, in his Paradise, what excuse have we, or can we make? if a tree brings not fruit which stands in a fat and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent soul, the fault is in the tree, not in the husbandman that planted it there: if a man standing in the Church of God, beareth not fruit, the fault is in man, not in God, who planted him therein: Our very being and standing in the holy Catholique Church obligeth us to bear fruit to God.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. God hath carefully provided all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary

Isa. 5 4. <hi>What could be done more to my Vineyard, that I have not done in it?</hi> as if God had said, I have done enough for this peoples conversion and reformation: I have bestowed upon them, my word and Ordinances which are able to save their souls: I have sent forth la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers my Ministers to warn them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, to call and invite them to repentance: I have threatned evil against them, I have promised them all good, I have bestowed many mercies and benefits on them, and I have also punished them. I have given them all necessary instruments and means of salvation, and yet I find no fruit on them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. God hath offered grace to us, but men willingly reject the offers of God, 2 Cor. 6.1. <hi>We beseech you that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.</hi> God by the Gospel and our Ministry offereth his grace to you, but men receive it in vain, they make light of all Gods offers.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. God oftentimes sends down his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to move upon mens hearts secretly and inwardly moving and exciting them to repentance; but men quench his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, strive against h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:206435:137"/> all his spiritual and strong motions vanish like the print of a seal stamped upon wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Oh judge whether God be in fault that ye have no fruit growing on you.</p>
                        <p>Neither are Ministers in fault, that ye have no fruit on you: we do the duty of Ministers: we pray, we preach the word of God to you; we plant, we sow, we digg about you, we dung you; we teach and instruct you how to repent, how to believe, and we do the duty of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent husbandmen in the Lords Vineyard: Judge I pray you between Ministers and your selves: What could we have done more to you that we have not done to you and for you? Every mans conscience shall one day lay the whole fault on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that God found no fruit on them standing in his Vineyard.</p>
                        <p>Hereunto let me add, neither are the means in any fault: for the Ordinances of God are in their own nature as apt to make the soul fruitful, as ploughing, sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, manuring is to make the earth fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Sheweth what fault is in our selves, that we bear no fruit to God.</head>
                        <p n="1">1. THE grand cause is our evil, dead, depraved and barren hearts: if the tree be dead at the root, it will never bring forth fruit: if the ground be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally barren; it will never bear fruit, though the husbandman should be never so labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in ploughing, sowing, manuring it: though he buyeth the best seed which can be had for money, yet all is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, if the soil be by nature barren: it is so in spirituals; the hearts of men are desperately wicked and barren above all things, that though God by his Ministers useth all means to make them fruitful; they are diligent and zealous in preaching, praying, instructing, exhorting, reproving, yet all in vain; because the hearts of men are barren by nature, they are trees dead at the root. <hi>Apollo's</hi> watering, dressing and pruning it, is to little purpose.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Mens wretched unbelief is another cause: John 12.38. <hi>Lord, who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved our report?</hi> We preach, but men
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:206435:138"/> believe us not; we shew men the danger of sin, the horrors of hell, of judgement to come, and so perswade men to bring forth fruit worthy of repentance; but men do not believe us, therefore bring forth no fruit: so Heb. 4.2. <hi>The word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith.</hi> For know, that to the bringing forth the fruit of saving faith, and repentance, a dogmatical or historical faith is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily required; for men will never repent of sin and turn to God, till first they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to this doctrine as a truth, that God will turn all the wicked into hell: unbelief makes men say in their hearts there is no God, no heaven, no hell, no judgement: let us eat and drink, for too morrow we shall die, there will be an end both of our souls and bodies.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Mens not receiving the seed of the word is another cause: it lies in the ear, and goes not down into the heart and conscience: men do but hear it, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mind the word afterwards: every truth is taken from them: our Saviour in the parable of the sower, gives this as one cause why men are unfruitful, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Some feed fell by the way side, and the fouls of the air came and devoured it up:</hi> all
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:206435:139"/> seed cast on the high-wayes and beaten paths is food for Birds: so it is with men Gods Ministers sow the precious seed of the word, and it lies upon them like seed in the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>gh-way; the Devil comes and takes all from them, devoureth every grain of truth: what fruit can we expect from such?<note place="margin">Paraeus in loc.</note> A learned Divine on the place saith, By the high-way side are meant all igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, careless, and forgetful hearers of the word; and all prophane despisers of the word of God; from them the Devil catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all they hear for the good of their souls.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The hardness of mens hearts is a cause of unfruitfulness: the best seed cast upon rocks becomes unfruitfull: this cause our Saviour also give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>h, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.5. some fell upon stony places, in such places the seed can never take root downward, and bring forth fruit upward: this is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reason why there is so much preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and so little fruit: we Ministers plough upon rocks, sow upon stones; that all our calls to repentance prove ineffectual, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. The Apostle coupleth hardness of heart and impenitency together; first hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, then impenitency; this stony heart must be taken away before we can bring forth any fruit meet for repentance.</p>
                        <p n="5">
                           <pb n="229" facs="tcp:206435:139"/>5. Mens hearts are over-grown with thorns and worldly weeds, and so prove <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nfruitful: this cause is given by our Saviour, Matth. 13.22. <hi>He that receiveth seed, is he that heareth the word; and the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful:</hi> his heart is empty of grace, whose head is full of worldly cares; they choke the power of the word, they choke all motions and convictions, they take mens minds off from the meditation and practice of the word to the saving of their souls.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Mens love of the pleasures of sin, and hatred of the strictness of holiness is another cause. <hi>Luther</hi> said of himself, that till the grace of God had subdued him, that his soul hated the word <hi>Repent]</hi> he could not endure to hear of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and turning from sin, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pleasures and profits of sin: even thus do the hearts of many wicked men, who have for a long while habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated themselves in sin, and have drunk deep of the pleasures thereof; they do hate and abhorr all exhortations and warnings to repent; they hate the Word <hi>Repent,</hi> and the very duty of repentance; they hate all
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:206435:140"/> holy strictness and preciseness, that all means prove ineffectual.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Mens taking of that for fruit which is not, is a great cause of their unfruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: when men judge their leaves of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and blossoms of duty and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal righteousness to be fruits, and rest there, no wonder if they be careless of bringing forth better fruit. How do good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings pass with some for good fruit? how do occasional and temporary affections pass with others for good fruit? the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Church conceived he was rich, and never looked further for better riches.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Another cause of unfruitfulness is the Devil; he is busie to sow his damnable tares where God soweth his seed; his wicked tares being more suitable to our depraved hearts, do spring up and grow, &amp; make the word become unfruitful. <hi>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:</hi> 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. If the converting and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying power thereof be hid from any, that they feel not the working thereof, it is an evidence that such men are lost; that is, that they shall perish and be damned for ever: the reason why it is hidden from them, is, <hi>because the god of this
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:206435:140"/> world hath blinded their eyes,</hi> that is, the Devil hath shut their eyes, hardened their hearts against the light and power of the Gospel,</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Mens own wilful carelesness is the cause of their unfruitfulness: how do men slight and neglect the very means of conversion, willingly turning away their ears from hearing the Law, and neglecting all means and duties, which in a natural moral way tend to make them fruitful: for albeit men are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to trees, yet they are not altogether like trees, which contribute nothing to their own bearing of fruit: for men have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reason and understanding, must do what they can by nature, and in a moral way do for the bearing of fruit: they must and can hear the word, but they will not; men must and can remember the word, but they do not; men must and can in a natural and rational way consider what the word of God saith, but they do not; yea men do not contribute so much as trees to their own fruit-bearing; for trees will suck that moisture which the heavens drop down upon the earth about them; but men do not suck moisture from the word which God raineth upon them.

                        <p n="1">1. Consider that God comes this day, this hour, this Sermon seeking for fruit; let him not complain and say, I find none, but still I find all wickedness in these men.</p>

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:206435:142"/> unfruitful men, Heb. 6.8. <hi>That ground which beareth briars and thorns is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing, whose end is to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>IN this Verse you hear what a sad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint the Lord made of the unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of his figg-tree, in which are these things observable.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. The owner or Master complaining, is God, who after the manner of men is brought in complaining.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="238" facs="tcp:206435:144"/>II. The person to whom this complaint is made; to the dresser of this Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; by him is meant Christ, because he is appointed by God to be <hi>Custos &amp; cultor Vineae,</hi> the keeper and dresser of his Church: he is the Head of the Church, the whole government of the Church is on his shoulders, because Christ hath all judgment committed to him; it is he that hath power to condemn, to destroy, to cut down: he hath the axe of vengeance in his hand to fell unfruitful trees, and to cast them into hell fire. True it is, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters are subordinate Vine-dressers; they are labourers sent by Christ to dress his Vineyard: they are to plant, to water, to prune, to lop, to digg about it, and to dung the trees by the Preaching of the word; but it is not meant of them, because they have not power to cut down.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. The thing complained of: he came for three years together seeking fruit, and found none: here we have two considerable particulars.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Gods wondering at this trees un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulness; he speaks after the manner of men. <hi>Behold,</hi> Is it not a strange thing that a tree of my planting in my own Vineyard should bring forth no fruit?</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="239" facs="tcp:206435:144"/>2. The space of time how long God had waited, expecting it to bring forth fruit — <hi>these three years;</hi> hence Divines gather, that if men do not bring forth fruits of grace after they have enjoyed the means of grace for a certain space of time, it is very improbable that ever they will bring forth fruit. By these years we are to understand a certain space of time which God gives men to repent; this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number is put for an uncertain; for some have a longer space given them; o hers have a shorter, as I shall further shew.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. A terrible sentence passed upon this Figg-tree: <hi>Cut it down:</hi> it is fit for nothing but to be fuel for the fire: those men whom no means can make good, are worthy to be cast into hell: graceless men are fit companions for graceless Devils.</p>
                        <p n="5">V Here we have a reason of this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere threatning: <hi>Why cumbreth it the ground?</hi> it is not only an unfruitful tree, but it is also a pernitious tree to the ground; it makes the ground about it bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, it spoileth other trees: Wicked men are not only injurious to their own souls, but to the souls of others: they hinder others from Conversion; they are a very burden to the Church.</p>

God for that space of time had spoken to them diligently, seasonably, and continually, but they obeyed not the Word of God: all the Prophets pains and diligence could not make that people bring forth fruit.

All our Talents are written down; our using, our abusing them; our improving, our hiding them; our spending, our mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spending them: all the times of Gods pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, goodness and long sufferance are written down: all the mercies we have received, all the ordinances of God, all the Sermons we have heard, are written down in the book of Gods remembrance, and in the book of our consciences; we shall all be called to give an account, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.15, 16, 17, 18, 19. under the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Talents Christ shews us how each
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:206435:150"/> man shall render an account of all his Talents. To some he gave five, to some two, to others but one: after a long time the Lord of the servants cometh and reckoneth with them, saith the Text. So likewise under the Parable of the unjust steward, Christ sheweth how God will reckon with every man, Luk. 16.1.2. <hi>Give an account of thy stewardship, for thou maist be no longer steward:</hi> here Christ calls all to give an account of their time, for they shall have time no more to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy: to give an account of their riches and mercies, for they shall enjoy them no more; to give an account of the means and seasons of grace, for they shall enjoy them no more. Oh consider, that there are no such Talents, as the time and means of grace are: these are mostly to be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; the mispending of these are most dangerous: men shall give an account, how they have mispent their riches, their honours: Magistrates shall give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, Ministers shall give an account, and Masters, all shall give an account for their Talents; every one shall come to a strict account for the times and means of grace enjoyed, of Sabbaths, of Ordinances, of Sermons, because these are the best Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,

                        <p>We find Christ sometime marvelling at the unbelief of men, Mark 6.6. <hi>He mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled because of their unbelief;</hi> for these very men were astonished at his wisdom which they heard, and at his mighty works which he had done: albeit they had such marvellous means of faith, yet they believed not, therefore Christ marvelled at their unbelief: sometimes Christ was grieved and angry at the hardness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief of men under the means of grace. It is an usual thing in Scripture to call to heaven and earth to be astonished at the wickedness of men, Isa. 1.2. <hi>Hear O Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and give ear O Earth:</hi> What is the thing that God summons heaven and earth to hearken to? <hi>The Lord hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me: the Oxe knoweth his Owner, and the Asse his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Crib, but</hi> Israel <hi>doth not know, my people doth not consider: Ah sinful Nation,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:206435:156"/> a people laden with iniquity!</hi> as if he had said: O ye Heavens, and all ye glorious creatures: O earth and all creatures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, be astonished at this people: I have been a tender Father to them, and have done what a good Father can do for them, <hi>yet they rebell against me:</hi> they have had all means of knowledge, yet they are more brutish, and more void of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then the Oxe or Asse, which are of all creatures the dullest; they know their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, yet my people do not know me their God; they neither love me, fear me, nor obey me, they are full of all wickedness.</p>
                        <p>For these Reasons God summoneth his creatures to hearken.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Because hereby God declareth the deafness of men: inanimate creatures are more ready to hear the will of God, then men are to hearken to his invitations to repentance.</p>

To shew to us, that all creatures which according to their manner are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to hear and obey the commands of God, shall one day be so many witnesses against men that will not obey his commands to repent, Deut. 4.6. <hi>I call heaven and earth to witness against you.</hi>

                        <p>I Shall now shew what causes there are of wondering and being astonished at mens impenitency under the means.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Is it not a wonder that men who are so much instructed, and told of the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of sin, of the dangerous effects and consequences thereof, and yet that men should live in sin, doth not the Scripture tell us, that sin makes us odious in the sight of God, as venimous Adders, as fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Swine wallowing in the mire, as Dogs licking up their own vomit, are in mans eye? to see a man drink down poyson that knows it not, is no marvel: doth not the Spirit of God tell us, that sin is rebellion, enmity, hatred against God? that sin turns men into beasts, and brings all wrath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on man, temporal and eternal, all plagues
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:206435:157"/> and curses whatsoever? that it is, and will be the ruine and destruction of mens souls? is not this matter of astonishment? Who cannot but be astonished to behold men to live and wallow in sin, to go on in soul-polluting and in soul-destroying cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as confidently as the Swine of the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darens</hi> did into the Sea? Is it not matter of wonder, that Hell fire, the everlasting chains of darkness, and all the torments prepared for sinners should not affright them out of their sins?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Is it not for an astonishment, that men hearing what sentence of death and condemnation God hath passed on them, that they should not take Gods prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed course to prevent the execution of these terrible sentences denounced by the mouth of God against them? if a Judge pass the sentence of death upon a man, and yet should shew him by what means he might escape execution: would not you marvel to see that man wilfully to neglect the means? or as if a Physitian should say to his Patient, you will certainly die of such a disease, if you take not this course to prevent it: how doth the word of God declare to us, that we are children of Gods wrath, heirs of Hell, that the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:206435:158"/> wrath of God abideth on us, that we are condemned; that God will turn all the wicked into hell; that wicked men shall die in their sins; that we shall all perish if we repent not: that for many years men have been forewarned of damnation, yet they repent not to prevent it, but go on in treasuring up wrath as greedily as world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings do their wealth: is not this matter of great astonishment?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Consider and then marvel, that God for a long space should use all moving ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to bring men to repentance, that he should intreat and beseech them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his grace, and be reconciled to him, that he should draw them with cords of love, his mercies, his promises, draw men with the cords of anger, his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and judgements; send his messengers rising early, calling and commanding men to repent, and that not once or twice, or for a day, but for many years (these three years saith the Text) yet no repentance; behold and wonder at it, O heavens, O earth: the <hi>Ninevites</hi> hearing but one Sermon calling them to repentance, they repented: but here are men who have heard hundreds, some thousands of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons warning them to repent, and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:206435:158"/> yet behold they repent not!</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Is it not marvellous to behold men go on in impenitency against many evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and strong convictions that they must repent! there is scarce a man that liveth under the means of grace, and is invited to repent, but knows it is his duty, that he must repent of his sins and amend his life: how many are there who are so fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with powerful exhortations and strong reasons, and convictions, that it is high time for them to repent! yet these very men in contradiction to their own convictions, do go on in the hardness and impenitency of their hearts: be ye asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished O Heavens and Earth at the unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of these men.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Marvel at it because of the reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of the wayes of God: he requireth no more at our hands but what is good, holy, and just to be done, Rom. 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> 12. <hi>The commandment is holy, just, and good:</hi> it is holy because it teacheth us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our hearts and lives to God: it is just because it commandeth nothing but what is just for us to do, to God, to our neighbours: it is good, because obedience thereunto makes us good: these are the fruits which God commandeth and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:206435:159"/> of. Name any sin, and you cannot but acknowledge it is a just thing for us to eschew it: name any one duty, it is just for us to perform it: if there were any unreasonableness in the service of God, in obeying his commands, there were some excuse for men why they should not conform to his holy will.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Because all the profit of our bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruit is our own more then Gods: tis nothing to God whether we repent or not; what if thou art damned? the loss is <hi>thine,</hi> not <hi>his;</hi> what if thou art saved? the gain is not <hi>his</hi> but <hi>thine;</hi> what if ye go on in your wicked wayes? it is to your own destruct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>on; <hi>do they provoke me to anger,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.19. No wrethes! <hi>it is to the confusion of your own faces.</hi> Do you by your impenitency vex me? no, you do but vex your selves, and are against your own souls; marvel at this that men should be such enemies to their own souls.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Is it not a marvel that any men should prefer the Devil and his service above God and his service, and count it a greater happiness to bring forth fruits to Devils, then to bring forth fruit to God? all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent persons do interpretatively say, that the Devil and their lusts are better masters then God.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. They are cumbersome to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: God speaks like one that is oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed under a burden: Isa. 1.4. <hi>Ah sinful Nation!</hi> Ah is an Interjection of sorrow: This sinful Nation, This sinful man, This obstinate Swearer, This swinish drunkard is a grief to my soul. So in ver. 14. <hi>They are a trouble to me, I am weary to bear them:</hi> I am not able to suffer or endure them any longer: It is spoken of God after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men, who are weary of bearing a
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:206435:161"/> cumbersome burden; in ver. 24. he saith, <hi>Ah I will ease me of mine adversaries.</hi> Ah] This particle of sorrow sheweth how cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersome they are to God: I will ease me of my adversaries by avenging my self on them; as a man that is tired with a cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersome burden, casteth it away from him, he will bear it no longer: so God saith, I will ease me of mine adversaries, I will destroy them, I will cut them down; those impenitent wretches shall be no more a trouble to me; they are so injurious to my patience, goodness, long sufferance, mercy, and abounding grace, that I cannot bear with them any longer; they are so injurious to my honor, that it is for my honor to bear with such fruitless and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable wretches no longer. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Amos</hi> hath a notable expression, Amos 2.13. <hi>Behold I am pressed under you as a Cart is pressed that is full of sheaves:</hi> it is in homely expression; yet being the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the Holy Ghost, we may use it: wicked men are as a heavy Cartload on the back of God.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. They are cumbersome to Christ: they are injurious to his death, to his life, to his benefits, to his love in dying and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering himself to us. See how angerly he
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:206435:162"/> speaks to his own disciples, because of their unbelief: and if he be angry with these green trees, which brought forth fruit in some measure, what shall he do to dry trees which bring forth none at all? <hi>Mark</hi> 9.19 <hi>O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you,</hi> or bear you? What! doth he speak thus in anger to his believing disciples? how then doth he speak to unbelievers, to all impenitent sinners, to a faithless and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent generation, how long shall I suffer you, seeing you are a shame to me, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to me, I am blasphemed through you and by you, how long shall I suffer you? though I bear with you long, yet I will not bear with you alwayes.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. They are unsufferable burdens to the Holy Ghost; they are they that grieve him, that quench him, that resist him; he is said to strive with them that he may make them to bring forth fruit: but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict him, and will bring forth wild grapes unfruitful works of darkness, that he gives over striving with them, as one that is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with striving: seeing you will not bring forth the fruits of the spirit, I will never strive more with you, and never shall you bring forth fruit: that tree is

LEarn hence the admirable patience of God in his suffering wicked men to live so long in the Church: O what just cause hath God to cut them down speedily, to ease himself of such who are adversaries to him, and to the souls of others! they are a burden to God. Lord! why dost thou not cut them down? they are injurious to the souls of all others. Lord! why dost thou not cut them down? it is because God is patient to such, and will warn them of damnation that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="3">3. Be exhorted to love and frequent such mens society, as will not for a world be cumbersome to thy soul, but will do what they can to help forward thy salvation: let barren trees stand by themselves; let fruitful trees be by themselves: what Christ said, the same do thou say, He that doth the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my Brother, and Sister, and Mother, and Friend, and All: they will provoke thee to every good work, they will say, come, let us go unto the house of the Lord, for he will teach us his wayes.</p>

The wrath of God will lye and abide upon you, it will be a burden too heavy for you to bear: The abuse of Gods patience and your unfruitfulness under the means will be a burden too heavy for you to bear.

                           </gap>ct between Gods justice and mercy, his patience and anger about unfruitful persons. In the verse foregoing you hear the justice and wrath of God thundering in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens against impenitent persons: <hi>Cut it down, why cumbreth it the ground?</hi> let not the axe be laid to the root of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:206435:167"/> figg-tree only, but cut it down, stock it up root and branch, and cast it into the fire; these unfruitful and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent wretches are good for nothing else, but to be the fuel of hell fire: they cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the ground, they take up room in my Church, and keep out others who would bring forth better fruit.</p>
                        <p>Now in this verse the mercy and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God intercedes, layes hold upon the hand of wrath and justice, making this intercession, <hi>Lord, let it alone this year also:</hi> Lord, do not yet cut it down: perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture this unfruitful tree may yet be made fruitful with a little more cost and pains: Lord, let these impenitent persons live a little longer under the means of grace; peradventure they may be led to repentance; try them but one year more. The Ministers of my word shall labour their repentance, and shall spend their strength, in praying for them, in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them; who can tell but they will yet bring forth fruits pleasing to the Lord of the Vineyard? this is the scope of these words.</p>
                        <p>Yet let us take a fuller view of the words; The Vine-dresser useth two arguments to moderate the rigour of enraged justice.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. The other argument is drawn from the tree: if more time, patience and means of grace will not, and shall not make it fruitful, <hi>then cut it down,</hi> then cast it into Hell fire.</p>

                        <p>I will not propose to you instances drawn from Scripture, seeing in every congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have very many evident and living instances to bear witness to this truth: how many of us have stood and (it is a sad word that I must speak) do still stand unfruitful in the Lords Vineyard! how do many of us deserve a cutting down, a casting into hell? how many are there among us who daily bring forth the wild grapes of drunkenness, swearing, and the like unfruitful works of hellish darkness! though many among us do persist in their detestable vices and practices to this day; yet still you have Sabbaths, ordinances, the means of grace, and Christ by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters is still labouring your conversion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and Salvation; not a drunkard, not a swearer this day but is a living instance
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:206435:168"/> of this truth; and must say, yet God lets me alone this week, this month, this year, to this day, and I am not cut down and cast into hell.</p>
                        <p>That we may the better perceive how patient and long-suffering God is to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful persons, I will first propose some things to your cosideration.</p>

The Lord saith, Hosea 11.7, 8, 9. <hi>My people are bent to backsliding from me; though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him,</hi> ver. 7. These words shew the obstinacy and impenitency of men; <hi>they are bent to
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:206435:172"/> backsliding:</hi> they are continually turning and revolting from me. <hi>They called them to the most High:</hi> (1.) They were called upon by the Prophets to turn to God, but none of them would give him the glory of their repenting. In <hi>verse</hi> 8. God saith, <hi>How shall I give thee up to</hi> Ephraim? <hi>how shall I make thee as</hi> Admah, <hi>and set thee as</hi> Zeboim? as who should say, This people deserveth to be cut down, as I overthrew <hi>Admas</hi> with fire and brimstone; they are as deserving of destruction as the worst of sinners. In <hi>ver.</hi> 9. he saith, <hi>My heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together, I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger; for I am God, and not man.</hi> These words do shew Gods infinite pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and forbearance to them, his unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness to cut them down: Though this people deserve destruction, yet my bowels are moved within me, I will not execute my wrath; for I am God and not man: I am God who can moderate my wrath, and not man who is peevish and froward, with whom there is but a word and a blow; I am God of infinite patience, and not man who hath but a dram of patience in him: I am God of infinite compassion, and not man whose compassions are little.
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:206435:172"/> Oh thou that dost daily go on in thy abominable provocations of God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art not destroyed. because he is a God whom thou provokest to anger, and not man; he lets drunkards alone for this year and that year, though they add drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness to thirst, and Oath to Oath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is God and not man: the meekest of men cannot endure such vile provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but their wrath would break out against them.</p>

                        <p>This may give an answer to that great question, Whether Christ died for all men? seeing the life of men is part of Christs purchase, the dayes and years of patience which all enjoy are parts of Christs pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase, more especially the means and space of repentance, the ordinances, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry are Christs purchased gifts; as to these things Christ died for all men: that life, that space and means of repentance; those extraordinary gifts which <hi>Judas</hi> had were the price of Christs blood for him, and in this sence he died for <hi>Judas</hi> as for <hi>Peter.</hi> There is not a wicked man but is obliged to give thanks to Christ for all the good that he hath; it is for Christs sake that thou hast the Sabbaths, that thou hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est this Sermon, and hast thy life lengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to this very day.</p>

                        <p>THese words are another argument of the Vine-dresser, moving the Lord of the Vineyard to forbear awhile the cutting down of the barren figg-tree. As the first is drawn from the Vine dressers further diligence and labour to make it bear fruit; This is drawn from the Tree it self; it is as if he had said; it
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:206435:178"/> may be this tree may yet bring forth fruit: this impenitent person may yet be led to repentance, and if he shall at the last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, it is well on all hands; then thou wilt never repent of forbearing him so long, and I shall never repent of my labour to make him to bear the fruit of repentance.

                           <p>IN prosecution of this point, I shall first shew how it is well on all sides.</p>
                           <p n="1">I. It is well for the Lord of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard in two respects.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. It is well for God, when a sinner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth, and bringeth forth spiritual fruit: for albeit our repentance can contribute nothing to Gods blessedness, nothing can be added to his infiniteness; whether we repent or not, God is infinitely happy;
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:206435:180"/> yet our repentance serveth for the illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the glory of his grace: oh how doth it shew forth the riches, the freeness, and efficacy of his grace in converting him, who to outward appearance seemed to be hopeless. It tendeth much to the praise of a Gardiner, who shall by his skill make a Tree fruitful, that was as it were dead; it is much to the praise of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, that shall by his pains and skill make a Wilderness to become a Paradise; a barren Heath, to become a fruitful Field: even so, it is much to the praise of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious grace of God, when he shall by his word and spirit make a profane wretch, one that was a very Monster of impiety, to become Godly, Holy, Heavenly. Who would have said, that <hi>Sarah</hi> should have a Child in her old age! who would have said that an old wicked wretch, an old drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, swearer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should become an holy, mourning, repenting, and reformed Saint in his old age! if ever any was ripe for Hell, this man was, yet now is he numbred among the Saints.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. It is well for God, because it is a pleasure and delight to him to see sinners turn and live; he desireth the conversion of sinners, and he delighteth in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:206435:181"/> and Salvation: wherefore when they do turn, it is great joy to him. <hi>There is joy in Heaven over one sinner that repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> The Prodigals repentance was his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers joy: My Son that was lost, is now found again: My Son that was dead, is alive again: My Son that was a rebell, is now obedient to me: He that was a slave to lusts and devils, is now become my Son again; He that was an heir of Hell, is now an heir of Salvation. Thus doth God as it were rejoyce over sinners when they repent.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. It is well for Christ when a wicked man brings forth fruit; for then he gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the fruits of his sufferings, and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the travel of his soul: all that Christ suffered was to make us to bring forth these fruits: those dolours which he felt and suffered in his soul and body; when the heavy wrath of God for our sins lay upon him, were thy conversion and faith: those graces are his purchase as well as his gift. <hi>When thou shalt make his Soul an offering
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:206435:181"/> for sin, he shall see his seed,</hi> Isa. 53.10, 11. The meaning is, when Christ shall deliver himself up to death for sin, then he shall see poor sinners repenting and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, who are his seed. <hi>He shall see the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel of his soul and be satisfied.</hi> (1.)

It is an high contentment to Christ to behold thee bearing fruit. Thou through thine impenitency (as much as lyeth in thee) makest Christ to die in vain, to endure all his Fathers wrath in vain: Methinks this should be a powerful perswasion to bring forth fruit, seeing thy repentance is the fruit of h s sufferings, and thy saith is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           <p n="2">2. It is well for Christ also, in that our bearing fruit is an high praise and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of all the pretious means and ordinances of grace which Christ for this very purpose hath appointed in his Church. Hath not he publ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Oh therefore when a man brings forth the fruit of repentance, the dignity and efficacy of his holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances do appear; what makes the world to think that there is nothing in the word and ordinances, that they are broken Cisterns, dry, empty things, and powerless, but this, that men live under them, and bring not forth that fruit for which they are appointed? There is none that can value them more than thousands of Gold and Silver, but such as have experimented the admirable efficacy of them upon their own souls: and the world thinks them to be useless things, and powerless means, as long as they behold men bringing not forth fruits meet for such holy and powerful or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</p>

And it is observable, what promise is made to the Church, wherein people are by the Ministry of the Word converted; <hi>The most high shall establish her.</hi> (1.) God will secure and sence that Church, God will establish his ordinances and Gospel there: it is mens unfruitfulness under the Gospel, which endangereth and brings the removal of the Gospel from this to another people: if we have any desire that God shall continue the Gospel and his ordinances, let us be fruitful, and God will establish: Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of converts are the glory of a Church, as multitudes of fruit-bearing trees are the glory of a Vineyard.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. It is well for the very Town and place

It is well for other barren Trees, when any one Tree becomes fruit-bearing: it is well for other wicked men when some are converted, because when one profane man is powerfully wrought upon, he will do his endeavour by his prayers, counsels, instruct ons to convert others. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.12, 13. <hi>Restore unto me the joy of thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, then I will teach transgressours thy wayes, and sinners shall be converted to thee:</hi> as if he had said, Lord make me to feel the comfortable effects of thy grace and favour, and I will by my example and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions endeavour the conversion of others. No sooner was <hi>Paul</hi> converted, but he planted and watered, digged and dunged to make others fruitful. So <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> calls <hi>Nathaniel</hi> to see Christ: and the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> when converted, calls all her neighbours to see him also; by this occasion many were converted, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.39. As a Ring touched with a Load-stone will draw another Ring to it, and that will draw a third, and that will draw a fourth: so when once the heart of man is truly touched with Christ, he will endeavour to draw others to him. Grace is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative and diffusive; Although it will not make a man a busie-body in other mens
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:206435:184"/> matters, yet it will make him very active in the conversion of other men; it will make a man to cry out with <hi>Paul, I wish that all that hear me now, were such as I am, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting these bonds.</hi>

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:206435:185"/> hath shewn mercy to a <hi>Saul,</hi> to a blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, to a persecutor, an injurious man, to one of the chief of sinners; how doth it raise up the spirits of trembling sinners to expect grace, mercy and comfort from God? if the grace of God makes such dry trees fruitful; shall not his Grace make green trees fruitful? If God turns such briars and thorns into figg-trees, there is hope that he will make you fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Oh do not despair, but hope and pray, when you see grace to abound where iniquity did so monstrously abound.</p>
                           <p n="8">VIII. It is very well for the Tree it self, for the man whom the Patience and forbearance of God, and the means of grace hath sweetly and powerfully led to repentance; if thou bearest fruit, it is well for thee. It is marvellous well for that sinner that is turned from sin to God, in these four particulars.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. It saveth a cutting down, it prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that damnation that slumbers not, it saves from being cast into hell-fire. The axe of Divine vengeance shall lie no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at the root of that Tree that bringeth forth good fruit, Joh. 6.37. <hi>Him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi> No Gardiner will cut down his best Trees.</p>

                           <p n="3">3. Tis very well for him, because now God himself will take special care of him, and will make him more fruitful, Joh. 15.2. <hi>Every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit:</hi> lusts are great hinderances of fruit-bearing; God will purge him from these, that he may abound in fruit; God will make all means powerful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="1">1. My Text informs us, that Christ the Vine-dresser will make no more intercession for the continuance of Gods patience and the means of grace, he will never speak one word more to the Master of the Vineyard, Lord, let him alone another year also, and I will digg about him and dung him; if Christ interceded not, ye are undone.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Ministers may make intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for them, because they know not when the day of grace is expired; yet God will not hear their prayers for them. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 15.1. The Lord said unto me, <hi>Though</hi> Moses <hi>and</hi> Samuel <hi>stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people; cast them out of my sight:</hi> that is, if those two holy men should stand and intercede for this people, yet I would not hear them, as I have done in former times: the most righteous, fervent, praying Ministers shall not prevail with me for them: cast them out of my fight like vile and abominable persons.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. They shall pray for themselves Lord,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:206435:189"/> spare me, and shew mercy to me, and I will be a better man; but all their cries and prayers for themselves shall not be heard, Prov. 1.28. <hi>Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but the shall not find me, for that they hated knowledge, and did not chuse the fear of the Lord:</hi> you would not hear me inviting you to repentance; now I will not hear you praying for mercy; you hated the knowledge of God, you despised grace and holiness; therefore I will despise your prayers: you slighted mercy offered; now I will despise your prayers for mercy.</p>
                        <p>For proof that such persons shall be cut down; consider Prov. 29.1. <hi>He that is often reproved, and hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy.</hi> That man that goes on in the hardness and impenitency of his heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the means of grace, sudden and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diless destruction shall come upon him; you shall have more proofs and instances in the further handling of the Doctrine.</p>

                           <p>LET me now in the first place explain what this cutting down is. There is a threefold cutting down of unfruitful persons.</p>
                           <p n="1">I. There is a spiritual cutting down of them: this judgement is spiritual and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible, therefore it is more terrible in it self, though not to the party himself, nor to others, spiritual judgements are double judgements. This cutting down is many wayes effected.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Either by withdrawing the means of grace from them, when God shall remove the Gospel, Ordinances, and Ministry from a people. Isai. 5.5. <hi>And now go to, I will tell you what I will do to my Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and breaks down the wall, and it shall be trodden down, and will make it a desolation;</hi> that is, I will remove all mine ordinances from them, and will have no more care of them, but let lusts and Devils tread them down. Thus did God cut down the Jewish
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:206435:190"/> Church: that very Paradise in the world is now become an howling wilderness: and thus God hath cut down the seven Asian Churches by removing the Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick from them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. &amp; <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Or by withdrawing the power and efficacy from the means of grace; that all the means of grace shall do a man no more good than the application of warm cloaths doth to a dead Carcass: Men shall stand in the Vineyard under Gospel ordinances, but the Preaching thereof shall be to them a favour of death: the things that belong to their peace shall be hidden from their eyes; the Word shall fall upon them like rain upon Rocks, and soften them no more then rain doth soften the rocks: they shall relish no more sweetness in Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, then in a dry chip; the word of God shall no more terrifie them, than thunder doth a deaf man; they shall wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and wilfully make light of all Gods counsels and invitations.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. God will give them up to their own lusts, imaginations, and vile affections: Oh! it is sad when wicked men do walk after the imaginations of their own hearts, and obey their vile affections <hi>t</hi> yet such men may be at length converted: but
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:206435:190"/> when God shall judicially give them up to their own vile affections, when God in wrath and vengeance shall say to a man; <hi>Let him that is filthy, be filthy still, Let him alone,</hi> let him that is wicked be wicked still, let him alone, let him walk on still in his abominable wayes: woe to the soul from whom God thus departeth.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. By shutting them up in unbelief and impenitency: all wicked men are unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and impenitent; yet still there is hope, that they may in time believe and repent; but when God shall judicially shut them up in unbelief, then they shall never believe, they shall never repent: the figg-tree could never bring forth fruit, because Christ had cursed it, saying, <hi>never let fruit grow on thee;</hi> so such men being cursed of God never let faith and repentance grow on them, never let them come to the knowledge of the truth, Isa. 6.9. <hi>Go and tell this people, hear ye indeed, but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not, see ye indeed, but perceive not:</hi> (1.)

And as
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:206435:191"/> there is a determinate measure and fulness of grace to which the godly do arrive, then death cometh and transplanteth them into heaven; so there is a fulness of sin to which wicked men shall come, then death translates them into hell: and untill their sins be full, God forbears to cut them down, and means are used for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version: but when their sins are full, there is a period of Gods patience toward them, and then God in wrath takes them out of the world: and know ye that some mens measure of sins is sooner filled up then others; hence it is that some men are sooner cut down then others: we see how some wicked men do not live out half their dayes, and other wicked men live a longer time: but be assured, as soon as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed dayes of Gods long-sufferance are expired, God will then cut them down by death, and no means, no prayers shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it: but men see this cuting down to be common to the fruitful and unfruitful trees, and therefore do not much regard it, though there is a vast difference between their cuting down by death.</p>

(for there are some Furnaces which the wrath of God causeth to be heated seven times hotter then other) even they are cast into them who have had more riches of patience and long-sufferance, and more means of grace than other persons.

The Prophets before <hi>John</hi> did prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of the coming of Christ; but <hi>John</hi> preached that he was come, did point at him with his finger, Lo yonder is the Christ: <hi>Behold the Lamb of God which takes away the sins of the world!</hi> albeit <hi>John</hi> was so great a man, yet saith Christ, <hi>he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven, is greater then he.</hi> The Antients puzzeled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the sense of these words. Some think it is meant of the Angels in Heaven, that the least of them is greater than <hi>John.</hi> Others think that he meaneth the glorified spirits of just men, the least among them is greater then <hi>John.</hi> Others think it is meant of Christ, called <hi>least</hi> in respect of his outward condition in the world; he was sl ghted by men as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible person. Others take it for every mean believer in this Evangelical state of the Church; the least believer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:206435:202"/> the Gospel, is greater than <hi>John</hi> living under the legal Ministration. But I find that Interpreters generally take it for the meanest and least Minister of the Gospel: how despicable soever they be in the eye of the world, yet the least of them is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, the greatest, but the last of the Prophets under the Law. The reason why it is meant of Ministers in office, is, because Christs Discourse is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together concerning Prophets and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ. And every Gospel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster is greater than <hi>John,</hi> because they preach that Christ hath finished the work of redemption, which <hi>John</hi> did not: he told the people that Christ was come, and therefore was greater then all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. But we preach that Christ is come, and also that he died, was buried, and is risen again, is ascended into heaven, sitteth at the right hand of God, he hath fulfilled all prophecies of him: therefore we are greater than <hi>John</hi> and all the Prrphets.</p>
                        <p>If I should make any Observations from hence, you would not believe them, though they be told you from the mouth of Christ; as that we may learn hence, that the office of a Gospel-Minister is a most glorious office, how contemptible soever it be in
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:206435:202"/> your eyes. Hence also we may learn not to despise the least Minister of Christ: in so doing, you despise him that is greater than all the Prophets, and <hi>John</hi> the Baptist; and you would despise them if they were living? God will in time take vengeance on all such persons. Moreover, hence you may see how happy the condition of those is, who live under a Gospel-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.</p>

                        <p>IN handling this point, I shall first shew you what this violence importeth.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It denoteth the bent and peremptory resolution of the will for Christ, grace, and Salvation: that as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of worldly men, <hi>They will be rich:</hi> their wills are set upon the gaining of riches, and they will seek them, come what will; so a violent Christian is set upon having Christ, he will have Christ, he will be god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he will be saved; this is his resolution,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:206435:205"/> I must, I will follow Christ; I must, I will be saved: experience tells us that violent men are wilfull men; the more violent, the more wilfull; and violence is nothing else but wilfulness: this I will do, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to do, saith the violent man; no entreaties, nor perswasions shall take them off from what they will do: in this holy violence there is an holy and spiritual wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness: they are resolved to be godly, and to carry heaven as it were by force, nothing shall disswade them, but they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ll have their wills.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It importeth strength and fervour of affections: this followeth upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; the Will commandeth and carrieth the affections with it; what the will runs after, that the affections do violently pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, that doth a violent Christian love, desire, in that doth he delight above all things. As when a man loveth riches &amp; honours, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth them above all things; the full stream of his affections runs violently after them: so it is in spiritual violence, the strength and violence of the affections are carried out, and run after God, and salvation. In Scripture therefore it is compared to hunger, and thirst, and longing which are violent desires: the hungry man must and
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:206435:206"/> will have meat, and desireth nothing else but meat, and nothing can satisfie him but meat: so the violent Christian, he hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greth and thirsteth and longeth for Christ; he must and will have him, and nothing but Christ can satisfie him, Psal. 84.1, 2. <hi>My soul longeth, yea fainteth, my flesh cryeth out for the living God:</hi> the Saints longing after God is nothing else but the violence of their affections; passionate and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate men are violent men: the more passionate, the more violent: What strange acts of violence do men in their heat of passion!</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It importeth an earnestness and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in the use of all holy and appointed means tending to the obtaining Christ and the Kingdom of Heaven: violent men are not idle, dull, lazy persons, but earnest, active and industruous in their businesses: and the more violent any man is, the more earnest he is; violence is the utmost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of activity: so wherever this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual violence is, there is wondrous activity in Gods service and wayes.<note place="margin">Psal. 119.32.</note>
                           <hi>I will run the way of thy commandments</hi> saith <hi>David:</hi> he will not only walk in them, but run; there is great violence in running. In <hi>Act.</hi> 26.7. we read of the Tribes serving God instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;

                           </gap>, that is, they served God to the utmost of their strength. So we are commanded to serve God with all our soul, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>h all our might, as labourers do their work with all their might and strength: the world wondereth what it is that makes these men so eager after Gods ordinances, and so earnest in holy exercises; it is a principle of holy violence: they are called upon <hi>to give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to work out their salvation, to make their calling and election sure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. which some parallel to my Text, giving all diligence, <hi>add to your faith vertue, and to vertue knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. as who should say, be diligent in adding grace to grace, and duty to duty.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It imports the importunity of the soul in prayer for the obtaining these things: they cry out, Lord, give me grace, pardon; Oh give me Christ, give me thy favour; Lord, help my unbelief, my impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency. The Apostle calls it fervent praying, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. violent praying. The Prophet compares it to <hi>Jacobs</hi> wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Hosea.</hi> 12. S. <hi>Paul</hi> expresseth it by sighes and groans unsufferable: groans are the violent expressions of a praying soul. Christ expresseth this by a Parable of an
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:206435:207"/> importunate Widow to an unjust Judge, Luk. 18.5. <hi>Because this Woman troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me: And the Lord said, hear what the unjust Judge saith:</hi> now as she, so doth a violent soul as it were with an holy importunity troub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e God, and gives him no rest, but is continually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, Lord, pardon me, Lord renew me, Lord help my unbelief. So the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanitish woman, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27. she would not give over cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Have mercy Lord on me thou Son of</hi> David: though Christ gave her no answer, still she cryed after him, <hi>have mercy on me:</hi> Christ called her Dog; she replyeth, though I am a dog, yet give me crumbs, have mercy on me: she cryed importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately till she obtained her desire. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the two blind men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20 30, 31. cryed out, <hi>Have mercy on us, Lord, thou Son of David:</hi> the more they were rebuked, and bidden to hold their peace, the more thy cryed out, Have mercy on us; they would not give over till they had their desire granted them.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. It implyeth an holy impatience and restlesness of spirit; violent men are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes impatient men; delayes draw out
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:206435:207"/> their violence and impatience; so where there is holy violence, there is holy impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence till they have obtained an interest in Christ, and a title to Heaven, and some solid assurance thereof. What are all those expostulations in Scripture, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of holy violence and impatience? <hi>How long wilt thou forget me O Lord, for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?</hi> Psal. 13.1, 2. <hi>Lord, why castest thou off my soul, why hidest thou thy face from me?</hi> Psal. 88.14 Violent men are like persons in great pain, impatient till they have ease given them.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. It imports a constant earnestness and eagerness in seeking the things of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Philosophers say, that <hi>nullum Violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est perpetuum,</hi> no violent thing is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, but it is not true of spiritual vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; this is perpetual and constant; though not at all times in the same height and degree, yet it is alwayes more or less: for it is not a fit, a humour, a passion, but it is like fire when kindled, continually burning, while fuell lasteth. A wicked man, an hypocrite may in a fit passionately cry out for mercy, while sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or terrour is upon them, or some judgement feared; but when these fits are
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:206435:208"/> over, their violence goes out, and appears no more: but holy violence is perpetual, is alwayes eager and earnest for Christ, in health as in sickness; out of fears, as when a man is in his fears: he never prays but he offereth a holy violence to Christ and Heaven: it is like the fire on the Altar which was kept continually burning.</p>

                        <p n="6">6. Because all the works of Godliness and salvation are very hard, therefore holy violence must he used: we read, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.18. that <hi>the righteous shall scarcely be saved:</hi> they shall be saved, but with much difficulty, and the difficulty ariseth not only from our own hearts, lusts, devils, and the world, but also from the difficulty of the works of Godliness; it is an hard matter to pray as we ought, to hear as we ought; it is hard to believe, it is hard to forsake sin, it is hard to obey God uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally: there is not one duty in God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, but the common experience of all the Saints saith, it is hard to do: where difficulty is, there must be violence used to overcome the difficulty; formality and laziness will never carry a man through to heaven; and there is a reason why some men leave off building, having begun, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they find it a difficult work to finish the work of Salvation: there is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:206435:213"/> in this work than they did consider of before they took the profession of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in hand: he spoke like an experienced Christian who said, <hi>Christianus est perpetuae naturae violentae,</hi> a Christian is one that offereth perpetual violence to himself.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Because of the continual presence and opposition of evil in the whole course of Godliness: in the first act of conversion there is great violence in breaking off from sin, and turning to Christ; but sin is not perfectly subdued, nor is grace perfected in that moment: but sin remains still in us, and the measure of grace is but weak and imperfect: there is and will be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual conflict between sin and grace, that godly men have great need to keep up a daily exercise of their holy violence, to beat down sin, and to keep up grace in its strength and vigour: <hi>when I would do good, evil is alwayes present:</hi> these twins are allwayes strugling in the heart; that of necessity we must exercise holy vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: for as our violence abateth, so sin grows stronger and stronger, and grace becomes weaker and weaker: As while the hands of <hi>Moses</hi> were lifted up to Heaven, <hi>Israel</hi> prevailed; when they were let down, <hi>Amalek</hi> prevailed over <hi>Israel:</hi> so it is in
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:206435:214"/> the whole course of our lives; while Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians (<hi>Jehu</hi> like) march on with an holy fury, and pray fervently against their lusts, grace prevails; otherwise sin gets the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Because there is no getting Heaven without violence, no entring into it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out striving and pressing into it: Cities and Castles are not won by setting down and standing before them, and looking on them, but by storming, and venturing hard for them: so neither is Heaven taken by wishing and woulding, but by our strongest endeavours, and holy earnestness to win it. Nothing below Heaven is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by wishing and woulding: it is not he that wisheth that he may be rich, but he that will be rich, and laboureth hard to be rich: the sluggard in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> did desire food, but had none, because he folded his hands in his bosome, and would not take pains: Heaven will not drop into any mans mouth: Heaven is compared to an high hill, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. there is no ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up but by holy violence; <hi>faciles descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Averni:</hi> it is easie to go down to Hell.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Sheweth whence this holy Violence ariseth.</head>
                        <p>NOW would you know whence this holy violence ariseth, I shall shew you.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It proceeds from the spirit of God: holy violence is not from nature; we can no more move our selves without the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, than a dead man can move without the soul within: till God draweth, we cannot run: till God enable us, we cannot think a good and an earnest thought of Heaven: a Christian can do all things through Christ strengthening him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> signifieth Christ making me able and potent; for holy violence is the spiritual fiery temper of the soul, which none can kindle in us but the spirit, which is compared to fire; it is he that makes us fervent in spirit: God is <hi>purus actus,</hi> a pure act: where the spirit of God is, there is activity, strength and vigour.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It cometh from the deep and serious apprehensions of their own dangerous state and condition; they feel their sins a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den too heavy for them to bear; therefore they must have Christ upon any terms, to
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:206435:215"/> free them from that intolerable burden; they fear hell and damnation, and are affrighted with the dreadful thoughts of burning in Hell: therefore do they strive to enter into Heaven, press into it, and take it by force; they will be earnest for Heaven, that are terrified with the fears of hell; none but the man-slayer runs to the City of refuge; none but the condemned person is violent in pursuit of a pardon: none but he that is sick unto death is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for recovery from death and sickness: and none but the burdened sinner is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for pardon and life eternal: men are careless of the salvation of their souls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are fearless of the damnation of them: the whole see no need of the Physitian.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It proceedeth from strong convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and perswasions of an absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of an interest in Christ, that they must be damned, if they have not Christ: then they are impatient, restlestless, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for an interest in Christs satisfaction and righteousness. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> made his Army to be valiant and violent in fighting, when he told them, that either they must eat up the Army of Spaniards before them, or they must drink up the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:206435:215"/> Sea which was behind them; either they must all die or conquer: so when a mans conscience shall tell him, either you must have Christ, or else you must drink up the brook of Gods wrath; then are they eager and violent for Christ, I must have Christ, or else I am undone eternally; none but Christ, none but Christ can save me: when men see that there is an absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of a thing, they will have that thing, if it be to be had for love, money, or labour: an absolute need of Christ puts men upon taking Christ upon any terms.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. From their sight of Heaven by faith: they see by faith the incomparable riches of Christ, and the unutterable things which <hi>Paul</hi> saw in Paradise; they see the things which are not seen, and are eternal: that the winning of Heaven will make them a sufficient and eternal amends for all their pains-taking to get it. Let a General tell his Souldiers, that there are inestimable treasures in the besieged Castle, and say to them, Win it, and all shall be yours; how violently will they storm the Castle, but they will have the treasure in it! so God having promised in his word to all that shall strive to enter into Heaven, and shall
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:206435:216"/> press into it, to all that shall give diligence to work out their salvation, to all that shall hunger and thirst after him, that they shall have Heaven and all the glory, joy and happiness in it; all the goodness laid up therein shall be theirs; these promises make believers to aspire to be diligent, to be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> I can win heaven, I shall have all that is in Heaven: what is ease, life, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to Heaven! farewell all that I may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Kingdom of Heaven. I will have Heaven though I die in and for the pursuit of it: Heaven will make amends for all that I can do or suffer for the gaining thereof.</p>

All men say that Christ and Heaven is worth the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but they do but say so, and not judge so; if they indeed value Christ and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they would be more eager and earnest after them, then they are; they would like hungry men break through stone-walls, break through all difficulties, but they would draw waters out of the fountain of salvation: he that valueth Christ and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven more than others do, will do more for Christ and Heaven than others; Christ will have men know and judge, that he is worth the having, and that Heaven is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding worthy of all our labour and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: such as thus value Christ and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and accordingly labour to obtain them, their violence shall not be in vain: Heaven shall be the reward of holy vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>

                           <p n="4">4 Either you must take heaven by force, or hell will take you by force: all men shall either be Kings with God, or damned slaves with Devils in hell: shall not we be violent to escape hell? where is the man that will not use his force and might to escape death and damnation?</p>

                           <p n="2">2. Woe to such who are violent for hell: that burning prison of the damned suffereth violence, and there are many that take it by force: are there not too many among us who will be wicked, who will do what they please? that as violent Christians break through all impediments in their way to heaven, so there are vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wicked men who break through all impediments which God lays in their way to hell, who break through all Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, counsels, reproofs, threatnings,
